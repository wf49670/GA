PREFACE
.pi
.sp 2
.dc 0.4 0.4
THIS volume is a report in shorthand of the
Scammon Lectures as I gave them at the
Chicago Art Institute, April, 1920. If, therefore,
the book seems to be talked instead of written,
it is what I want, what I said, what I have
learned, what I believe. It was inevitable, however,
by this method, that there should be repetitions, and
references to subjects and slides shown at the lectures
which do not appear in the pages. I have
referred to this in the Introduction, and also said
that I wished to make the book in this fashion. I
have done so. It is myself. And though talked
in six hours, it has taken sixty years to get together.
I hope students may be induced to believe as I do—for
I know if they do, they will not be led astray, as
they often are, by blatant bellowings, by mechanical
makeshifts, by the false prophets shrieking that
anyone can be an artist, especially if he attend a
correspondence college or a get-rich-quick school run
by these prophets or their friends; and people who
tell you that art can exist without craft—handicraft—and
the most skilled craft, are false prophets.

I hope that the book may lead students back to
the straight, hard, and narrow path from which in
these last years they have so sadly strayed. I hope
that it may prove to them that the Graphic Arts are
as serious as any of the other arts. I hope that it
may show them or point out to them the masterpieces
of the Graphic Arts, and that without work,
belief, and knowledge we can do nothing, despite the
difficulty-dodgers of this artless, aimless, shiftless
age, who are the curse of the age, the hope of the
lazy and the unfit, who look to art for an easy living,
not as a most difficult profession.
// 009.png
.pn viii

I have spoken of the crying need for a national
department of art, a national school of art, national
encouragement of art. The politicians are too ignorant
to encourage art now, but they will when they
are made to see it will pay.

It is the highbrows, the intellectuals, the amateurs,
and the uplifters who have grabbed art in
our country. They are afraid of national art,
national art education, for even they know that if
art became a national factor they would lose their
jobs—and rightly—of teaching and preaching what
they cannot practice.

There are art schools that are taking up practical
art and craft education, and there are artists who
are teaching practically their trades, but many are
doing harm to students, telling them how to make
big money quick, and that is the aim of the people
of this country—ignorant that art is the most
difficult and most underpaid profession in the world.
It is, however, for money that the immigrant comes,
and the American still exists here. They know no
better, but art is dying of thirst in a dry desert.
And we have no graphic art and craft school properly
equipped in the country.

THE GRAPHIC ARTS  MODERN MEN|AND MODERN METHODS.\_INTRODUCTION


.dc 0.1 0.4
I LEARN that these lectures are primarily intended
for students, according to the terms of
the Scammon Bequest, and it is to students,
therefore, that I wish primarily to address myself.
In previous years several authorities have discussed
certain aspects and forms of the Graphic Arts. But
these addresses have been mostly devoted to the
history of the Arts, to the work of the past—“made
out of books,” as one lecturer has said, rather than
out of experience and practice of men of the present.
I believe that we should study the work of our
predecessors, for unless we know what has been
done, and the methods by which it has been done in
the past, we cannot know whether we are carrying on
// 019.png
.pn 2
the great traditions on which all great art is founded;
we cannot know whether we are advancing, whether
we are re-echoing the past, whether we are standing
still, or whether we are degenerating.

There was one notable exception among these
lecturers, who have taken the Graphic Arts as their
subject—the late F. Hopkinson Smith, on <i>Outdoor
Sketching</i>. Mr. Smith was an able, practical exponent
of this form of art. Mr. Smith, however,
treated only one phase of a great subject. Mr.
Carrington treated another in <i>Engravers and Etchers</i>.
Mr. Smith’s lectures were the result of a life
passed in practicing what he preached; Mr. Carrington’s
were made from the books and prints he
has studied. Both were valuable documents. I
wish, however, to try to combine them, though
I shall confine myself to modern Graphic Art, to
modern men and modern methods, especially to the
men who have carried on the traditions of the past
and applied them to the methods of the present.
For it is impossible in this world—or what was the
world—to create anything new, to be original. We
can only carry on. But in every art and craft the
men who have carried on are called inventors,
creators, original, when they are only intelligent students
of the past who have advanced their art one
step in their own age by adapting the work of the
past to their own needs. I wish also to include in
the Graphic Arts only Drawing, Engraving, and
Printing, not all forms of art, save Sculpture and
Architecture, as Hamerton did in his great book on
<i>The Graphic Arts</i>.

Nor am I going into the history of the Graphic
Arts to any extent; but there are great landmarks
in the past that I must refer to. There is the wood
// 020.png

cutting of the Japanese from which we have learned
so much and must learn much more, or the Chinese
from whom the Japanese learned everything. There
are the old German and Italian draughtsmen, engravers,
and printers, some of whom are still our
masters and our inspiration; some of whom we have
not surpassed, nor even approached. Still, unless
we have a knowledge of those masters of the past
and their methods, we can make no progress in the
present. And it is these modern methods and the
men who intelligently use them today that I wish
to discuss. It is impossible for me to refer to every
eminent illustrator in these lectures—and still more
impossible to include the work of all to whom I
have referred.

I wish to thank the Trustees of the Art Institute
for the honor they have done me by inviting me
to deliver the Scammon Lectures. To thank the
Director, Mr. Eggers, and other officials of the
Institute and especially Miss McGovern, who have
so greatly aided me in preparing the illustrations
for the lectures, reproduced in this volume. In
fact, on this and other occasions, I have only to
thank everyone connected with the Institute with
whom I have come in contact. And finally I only
hope the lectures may be of some benefit to the
students.

.dc 0.4 0.4
IT is stated that one of the functions of the
Scammon Lectures is that they are primarily
intended for students, and if I can address
myself to you as students this afternoon—for we
are all students, and we must be to the end of the
// 023.png

.pn 6
chapter—I shall have succeeded in doing something—something
worth doing.

One of the previous lecturers in this series said
on one occasion that it was his duty never to be
original, but to get everything he had to say out of
books. I do not believe in being original. There is
no such thing as originality in this world. The only
thing we can do is to carry on tradition. But when
it comes to taking facts that I have to put before
you out of books, it is rather difficult, because
there are few books on the graphic arts, although
all the work which I shall refer to is printed, and
the greater part of it has appeared in books. But
about those books, or rather the illustrations in them,
very little comparatively has been written; written,
that is, by the men who made them. Nor did most
of the draughtsmen and engravers describe their
methods of work.

There are today endless ways of reproducing
and printing illustrations. Artists seem to think
that anything can be reproduced and printed without
any training, without any technical knowledge, without
any thought of the chemical, photographic, or
engraving and printing problems which are involved,
but in every print, in every book, when the results are
not good, the artist is blamed. And this is not surprising,
because the artists of America mostly know
nothing about the crafts; yet the engravers know
little, and the printers do not care, most of them.
This condition of affairs has been brought about
because of the lack of proper technical art schools in
this country and a want of interest in technique on
the part of artists, and it is the want of technical
schools which we must fill. Until this Institute can
do something besides teach the fine arts, so called, it
// 024.png
.pn 7
really will have done very little to advance the
graphic arts. There is coming in this world a great
war in art, a war as great as the commercial war
now upon us. We are going to have to fight in
the immediate future not only our enemies but our
allies, and they are trained craftsmen, and unless
we are prepared to take up nationally the teaching
of the graphic arts and the applied arts and the
industrial arts, our enemies and our friends are
going to do our art work for us, and this country
artistically will be wiped off the face of the earth.
If we want a National Art we must have a National
Art School, a National Department of Art, and a
National Secretary of Art, or stop cackling of Art.

I propose to show what has been done in the
past by Americans and what has been done by
foreigners as well, not only by Americans, for though
I am proud to be an American, but scarcely
proud of my country or of most of the inhabitants
of it today, I do not believe that in art we are
bounded by the limits of the United States, by
ignorance of other men and other methods, or by
any other limits. We must know what has been
done in the past and in other lands in order to know
how to do better work in the present, and in order
to do that work we must be properly trained and
prepared. But today conceited amateur ignorance
covers this part of the globe. A belief that we
are the elect has blinded us.

You may say, and several people have said,
that the graphic arts are a very broad and a very
wide subject. Some writers have grouped among
the graphic arts all arts except sculpture and architecture.
I am not so desirous of extending the
borders; in fact, I have not time, and you would
// 025.png
.pn 8
not have time to listen to me if I made such a mistake
as to do so. All I want to talk to you about
is what I think, what I know, are rightly considered
to be the graphic arts. These are the arts of drawing,
engraving, and printing, in their various forms, and
these forms are very numerous, and if you students
are going to practice them you cannot practice
them out of your heads without technical knowledge.
You cannot use your imagination instead
of technical training. You must have skilled technical
training in order to do your work, and today
in this country you cannot get it. You must
become workmen. You may have genius, you
may have ability, but it will do you no good, unless
you are practically trained craftsmen, and that
you must be before you can do anything of any
value in the arts and crafts. If you have learned
only to draw and paint you cannot express yourselves
in the graphic arts at all. You may get
the results that you see in the newspapers and
magazines—and those newspapers and most of the
magazines and nearly all the books are a disgrace
to civilization, because of their technical imperfections
in illustration, engraving, and printing.

I am not going into the history of the graphic
arts. I mean I am not going back to the very
beginning of things because I have not the time,
and I should bore you with inartistic facts and
artless figures. I only want to show you what I
consider, what I know, to be great art and good
art, but talking and showing and listening will not
make artists out of you; only hard work will do
that.

The graphic arts have been practiced from the
very beginning of time. The Egyptians and the
// 026.png

// 027.png

// 028.png

.pn 11
Assyrians were designing posters when they carved
their reliefs. But these were so explanatory that
all could see and understand without legends and
slogans and so durable that they have lasted till
today. Wall paintings and sculptured shrines were
books for those who could not read, and no one
scarce could read. We who can read, thousands
of years after, marvel at them.

The first persons who practiced what we know
as the graphic arts were the scribes and illuminators,
and here is an early print (Page 1) showing
one of those scribes at work. He is working
in a library, writing and illuminating a manuscript.

COLLECTION OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO

Here is a page from an illuminated manuscript
(Page 9), and there is one thing about it I want to
point out to you. William Morris and Walter Crane
and others who have written of the graphic arts have
divided designs into two classes—decorative design
and realistic design. Now, as a matter of fact,
what we today call decorative design, except the
borders of this missal, was pure realism. Decoration,
what we call decoration, was realism in the
past when it was done. This is proved by the work
of the past, which the artists treated as realistically
as they could. This I maintain despite William
Morris and Walter Crane.

.ca PAGE 12    ST. CHRISTOPHER.  FIRST WOOD BLOCK, PRINTED IN\
GERMANY, 1423.  ARTIST AND WOOD CUTTER UNKNOWN

These illuminators and scribes wanted to multiply
their designs, and in order to do so someone—nobody
knows who—at any rate I do not—conceived
the idea of taking a piece of cherry or pear
wood and drawing on the side of it and cutting all
the undrawn-on parts of the wood away, leaving the
design raised above the cut-away portions, and
this was wood cutting. And when ink was rubbed
// 029.png
.pn 12
on the raised parts of the block, and paper placed
on it, and pressed on the ink, and the back of the
paper rubbed, an impression, a print, came off. This
block of St. Christopher (Page 10)[** ref] is one of the first, if
not the first, of the wood-cut blocks. It was done,
as you see, in 1423. But it all was one single, solid
piece of wood, drawing and text, cut with a knife,
and in order to print from it, the standing lines were
inked, and when a piece of paper was pressed on
these standing lines the portions which were cut out
did not receive ink, and when the paper was rubbed
on the back the design came off on it, and that was
printing. I have repeated this, but half of you
won’t remember. However, it was one solid design,
just as the work of the Japanese wood cutters is
today. But the scribes and wood cutters were not
satisfied with that. They next made books of
illustrations and text called block books, a block
to a page, and bound them.

.ca PAGE 12    WOOD AND METAL PLATES AND TOOLS USED IN ENGRAVING.\
DRAWN BY JOSEPH PENNELL

But before I go on to the next step I want to
explain, as clearly as I can, the various forms of printing
surfaces (Page 13).[** ref] Here is a wood block. The
block originally was as high as the tops of these
points and was cut away with knife and chisel,
leaving these points and ridges, which represent
lines and dots drawn on the block, standing in
relief. The next form of engraving was on metal.
In that, instead of leaving the lines in relief, the
engraver dug holes and pits and dots into the metal
plate, leaving the intervening spaces standing instead
of cutting them away, as in the wood block.
The ink was then rolled or dabbed on to the surface
of the metal, then cleaned off it, the rest of the
ink remaining in the holes and pits, and when a
piece of paper was put on the face of the plate,
// 030.png

// 031.png

// 032.png

.pn 15
rubbed or pressed with great force, the ink came
out of the holes and adhered to the paper. That
is metal engraving.

Another form of metal engraving was when the
engraver made furrows in the metal, leaving the
upturned metal standing. These upturned ridges
held ink, which gave added richness and produced
what we called dry point. Another method was to
cut off the raised metal, called burr, and leave the
clean sharp lines. These were made with a graver,
and such plates were metal engravings. Or the lines
were obtained by covering the plate with acid-resisting
varnish, drawing through that, and biting
the exposed lines into the plate with acid, the same
way as the engraver cut into the plates with his
graver, and the lines bitten in were filled with ink, the
surface cleaned off, paper placed on it, and under
pressure the ink came out of the lines. This is
etching.

Different tools are employed. On the wood block
the cutting knife is pulled toward you. The metal
engraver held the graver in his hand and pushed
it from him, drawing his lines with it. The dry
point was made with a heavy steel point, with which
the line was dug, while the etching needle is a
sharp-pointed instrument, the lines being drawn
through the surface of the varnished plate.

The third and last method is lithography. That
is surface printing, in which there is no relief or
depression, but the work is done by chemical
affinity. The design is made on a plate or stone
with greasy ink. The surface of the plate or stone
is dampened with water. Then ink is rolled on it,
which will adhere to the design only or to those
parts which are not dampened, because water repels
// 033.png
.pn 16
the ink, which is grease, from the undrawn spaces and
the ink is attracted to the greasy drawing. When
a piece of paper is placed on the plate the inked
design comes off on the paper. Lithography is
the simplest and most abused of all the graphic
arts and is the most wonderful. I shall go into a
detailed description of these technical methods
later, but I want you to understand at the beginning
the three ways in which prints are made.

Very soon after the wood block of St. Christopher
had been done, someone conceived the idea
of cutting up the blocks and cutting each letter
separately, and then of making casts of the different
letters. These were cut in metal and casts
made of each letter.

There is one thing you will have noticed about
these cuts of craftsmen, and that is the shops in
which they work. I am not a believer in uplift
and all that kind of thing; but I am a believer in a
person having a decent place to work in. Here is
another workman working at his trade, printing.
(See headpiece to Lecture 1.)[** ref] This is the original
form of press on which the most beautiful books of
the past were printed. This form of press is used
today, for in all the graphic arts we have made
comparatively little but mechanical improvement,
except notably in the application of steam and
electricity and the increase of rate of production; in
beauty and perfection of workmanship, none at all.

Two of these presses stand in the Plantin Museum
in Antwerp, which by the grace of God was not injured
in the cursed bombardments of the cursed
war, and instead of a union notice, there is over
them the figure of the Virgin. You can see the
bed on which the type is placed, and when it is

.pn 19
put there and inked and paper laid on it, the lever
is pulled and the impression is made, the tympan or
cover is raised and the paper lifted off with the
impression on it, and it was in this way that all the
early books were printed. All the work was done
by hand.

.pm il 030b 300 Page_13b
.ca PAGE 19    MODERN MULTIPLE HOE PRINTING PRESS

This is an American press, used today for fast
printing (Page 13).[** ref] The cut shows what has been
done in the development of presses. The modern
power press is an almost human machine that you
students, if you wish to be illustrators, engravers,
and printers, must learn something about,
and you must have one in the school and learn
to print on it. It is most fascinating to be allowed
to work on one of these machines. But unless you
get proper school equipment and machinery you
cannot do anything intelligently and practically.
We must have properly equipped schools, as they
have in Europe. In England and Germany, instead
of studying only painting and sculpture, in which
arts you will probably never succeed, you students
can be taught how to run a machine of that sort,
how to print and do something useful. And when
a student has learned a craft, like printing, he has
learned something which is very practical, something
which very few printers in this country understand
themselves. Yet printing is one of the most widely
used of the arts.

All those early books were printed on the tiny
hand presses, and the most beautiful examples of
printing in the world were done on them.

This is a page from the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, printed
in 1499 in Venice (Page 17).[**ref] You have never seen
anywhere at any time a more beautiful page. The
illustration signed with <i>b</i> is by some attributed to
// 037.png
.pn 20
Botticelli. Other authorities say it is the initial of
the engraver’s name. And all through the book are
equally beautiful designs, while the type and the
arrangement on the page are as perfect as anything
in printing.

There is one thing I want to point out to you—the
transition from the old illumination to the new
printed page. Note the little initial, a sort of key-*note
put there, so the illuminator, who at that time
had not gone out of business, should add beauty to the
decoration of the page by drawing in the initial
letter over it; and that scheme was carried on for
many years, until the printers learned how to print
letters in color, usually in two colors, blue and red.
The blocks from which these initial letters were
printed are preserved in the Mainz Gutenberg
Museum. They are made like a jig-saw puzzle
and fitted together after one had been inked in blue
and the other in red and set in the form with the
type and then all pulled together.

These wonderful books are bound in most gorgeous
covers, often of gold and metal, with jewels and
wonderful enamels inlaid, and they were placed in the
most imposing shrines. There is one of these shrines
in the Piccolomini Library, in the Cathedral of Siena
(Page 22).[**ref] Round the walls are missals, while above
on the walls are paintings by Pinturecchio. Another
beautiful library is at the Escorial near Madrid, and
the most interesting feature about that library is that
the books, instead of being placed with their backs
toward the spectator, are all put in the cases the
other way, with the edges all gilded, outward, and
the title is written in the corner in black. You
cannot imagine a more splendid gallery than that
wonderful library in the Escorial. It is a golden

glory. I know of no library to approach it, a solid
glitter of gold round the lower part, the great paintings
above; and it is that sort of thing that we must
work for again, to get the architect, the painter,
and the craftsman again working together to make
a thing of beauty like this library.

JOACHIM. WOOD CUT FROM “THE LIFE OF THE VIRGIN”

The man who really started book illustration
was Albrecht Dürer. There are most wonderful
examples of his work in the Apocalypse and the
Passion in the Buckingham Collection in the Art Institute
Print Room (Page 18).[** ref] He published his
prints and books, among them an alphabet. He
not only drew and engraved them and printed them,
but sold them, or, rather, he made use of his wife to
take them out and sell them in the market-place,
and in his <i>Journeys to the Netherlands and Italy</i> he
gives most amusing and most human accounts of
his experiences and adventures.

Another great illustrator was Holbein. He made
a series of designs for a Dance of Death, which
were copied and imitated all over Europe, for there
were thieves and imitators in those days. His metal
engravings of decorative objects are very perfect.

Here we have a caricature of the time of Dürer.
I regret to say that in this country at the present
time we have no trained craftsmen, and so have no
trained cartoonists, or much of the work on which
we have been brought up would never be printed.
I am afraid a caricature of this sort, if such a caricature
were published today, would raise a row. There
was a row then, and that was intended, and it made
a very big row. Now the person caricatured enjoys
it; then the caricaturist was a person to be feared.

If these artists wished to draw as they wanted
to draw, without thought of the wood cutter and
// 041.png
.pn 24
printer, they had no way of having their drawings reproduced,
except by engraving. Here is an example,
you might think it was done by someone today,
a drawing by Rembrandt (Page 25),[**ref] about as modern
as anything you could find and a splendid example
of technique. But there was no way by which Rembrandt
could have it reproduced, and he consequently
was forced to make etchings, which could not be
printed with type and cannot even now. Of these
“The Descent from the Cross” is a splendid example.

.pm il 043a 300 Page_26a
.ca PAGE 24  CLAUDE LORRAIN: PEN AND WASH DRAWING

Claude Lorrain, a few years later, was a great
draughtsman. I do not know of any artist today who
could make a more up-to-date pen drawing than this
(Page 26),[**ref] which was done by the seventeenth-century
Frenchman, who passed so many and such busy years
in Rome. He too was forced to etch, and he etched
vilely, despite the opinion of critics. For his own
pleasure, however, he made endless pen and wash
drawings in his <i>Liber Veritatis</i>, but these were not
reproduced till the last century in mezzotint. The
drawing is like a Corot done three hundred years ago,
but at that time there was no possible way of reproducing
it.

Rubens also illustrated. This design was not
engraved by Rubens himself, and there is nothing
of Rubens left in it, for the engraver copied it
stupidly. These drawings by Rubens were issued
and published from the great Plantin printing shop.
Printing offices today are filled with typewriters and
stenographers and that sort of thing; then they
were filled with beauty; and if you go into a proof-*readers’
room now you usually see through the
window the rapidly moving surface car or elevated
train. But in that room at Plantin’s you can see
with what delight a man could work, looking on a

quiet garden, and it was no doubt for that reason
they had time to design, print, and produce the
books they did. The Plantin family were book-*sellers
too, and lived in the works surrounding a
flowering, arcaded, quiet courtyard, and were not
ashamed. No doubt in the evening they and their
workmen drank together in the courtyard; now we
have stopped that, and mostly stopped good work
in consequence. After the Plantins’ great days,
there was scarcely any good engraving and printing
done in Europe and none over here.

The next man of power was William Blake, and
Blake, like all his predecessors, was a trained craftsman.
Here is one of his books, a most wonderful
book, the <i>Book of Job</i> (Page 27), which you will find in
the library, or, rather, a reproduction of it. In this
design and in all his other designs he combined two
methods—the design itself was etched or engraved,
and below in the text he used another method,
really a new one in its way. The legend was written
by Blake on the metal plate with some sort of
acid-resisting varnish made up like ink, and he bit
both parts at the same time and did something
which was more or less original. Blake’s works
are among the greatest of masterpieces. Finally
they were colored by his wife, wives then having
something more to do than vote and play tennis.

.ca PAGE 30  THOMAS BEWICK: THE WOODCOCK. DRAWN AND\
ENGRAVED ON WOOD BY BEWICK. FROM THE “HISTORY OF\
BRITISH BIRDS”

Another artist who appeared about the same
time as Blake was Thomas Bewick, also an Englishman,
and he had an idea that he could adopt and
adapt the methods and tools of metal engraving to
wood, that is, instead of using metal plates on
which to engrave his designs he could engrave them
on wood, using the graver to cut the white lines in
the block, engraving the design in white lines on the
// 047.png
.pn 30
cross-section of a piece of boxwood. This engraving
of a bird (Page 28) is from one of his numerous
books, his <i>History of British Birds</i>, and in the engraving
you see in a certain primitive kind of way the
great skill that the man had to produce and to
reproduce his own design, for he was not only the
engraver but the artist and the designer as well, and
that is what all great artists and engravers have
been. They have been trained to do, and they have
done, all their own work with their own hands. The
face of the block was blackened and Bewick drew
the bird with his graver in white lines, cutting the
design into the wood, and it printed as it looked
on the block.

Metal engraving died hard; many artists during
the middle of the last century employed it. Here
is a design by Turner, probably from a water color,
which was copied laboriously on to a plate of steel
or copper and published in <i>Rogers’ Italy</i>. But
metal engraving died out as a method of illustrating
books because, as I have said, it required two presses,
one for the illustration, another for the text; and
gradually wood engraving superseded it. After
Bewick had shown the way there arose a school of
men and women, pupils of Bewick. Here is the
work of one of them, an enlargement of a part of a
design by Benjamin Robert Haydon, engraved by
William Harvey, and this was engraved on wood
and printed with type, though it is a deliberate
imitation of a metal engraving. And that is the
reason why wood engraving superseded work in
metal, which required one press for the letterpress
and another for the prints.

// 050.png

of it. Blake’s wood engraving did not compare for
a minute with that of Edward Calvert, who also
worked under or after Bewick. This is one of the
most charming original engravings on wood (Page 28),
done by an artist almost unknown, but one who
worked with brilliancy and skill. Calvert is one of
the great names in British art, although there are
few designs by him, about half a dozen, but each
is a masterpiece. This was engraved about 1820
or 1830.

The art of wood engraving spread from England
about 1825 to France, and in France it was taken
up, as all new arts are, or newly developed arts,
by the greatest of artists. The most important
book which appeared in France was published in
1828 by Curmer, an edition of <i>Paul and Virginia</i>,
which contained designs by all the Romanticists,
engraved by English men and women. This design
was made with a hard lead pencil by Charles Jacque
on a tiny wood block one and one-half or two inches
in length. Then the engraver got hold of it and
made what he thought he should out of it, and
that was the end of it, for the drawing, being made
on the block, was all cut to pieces in the process of
engraving.

From France the art was carried to Germany and
was taken up by the greatest of German artists,
Adolph von Menzel, and his work too was done with
a hard lead pencil on the wood block, with probably
a certain amount of wash in some of the backgrounds.
All that work was done because Menzel loved it and
cared for it, and it was done so well because he
knew his trade. Yet he had to learn it himself;
and not only this, he trained his own wood engravers
to follow his lines. His greatest work is in the

many books during his long life. He is the creator
of modern illustration. Menzel told me that although
it was the hardest work in the world it was
the most delightful, a positive proof that this great
artist found nothing too big or too little to which to
devote his genius. Look at the character in the
tiny heads of Frederick and Voltaire and the others
around the table, the effect of moonlight (Page 31),
and in the other design the rendering of the retreat
in the snow—they are great art. There are hundreds
of other fine designs in the book.

The art then came back to England, and that
happened in this way. When Menzel had issued his
<i>Life of Frederick the Great</i> (1840), the English engraver
Dalziel showed it to the pre-Raphaelites, and
Rossetti made this design, which Dalziel engraved
for William Allingham’s <i>Music Master</i> (1855).
Every one of these artists took their illustrations
just as seriously as they took their paintings, as this
study in pen and ink proves, and here is one of
the illustrations by Rossetti for Moxon’s edition
of Tennyson, the great illustrated edition, 1857,
(Page 35) the greatest book of the fifties published
in England. It contained Rossetti’s design for the
“Palace of Art.” He, however, was never satisfied,
and no artist was ever completely satisfied with

yet it is just a design made for a page illustration
in <i>Good Words</i>, another popular paper, but where
can you find a finer study of a hillside than
that? There is nothing better in paint by Millais
or any other of the pre-Raphaelites. He did not
confine himself to one particular sort of work; it was
all in his day’s work. As Whistler said, “A man
who cannot draw everything cannot draw anything.”
Please remember that Millais showed in
this illustration to Trollope, engraved by Joseph
Swain, that the crinoline was beautiful. Everything
in the world but billboards is beautiful if you can
see it—but they are damnable, and you can’t help
seeing them.

Fred Walker was one of the younger men, one
of the great artists of England in the sixties, and
that period was called the Golden Age of English
Illustration. If any of you can find any old volumes
of the first ten years (1860-70) of <i>Once a Week</i>, or
<i>Good Words</i>, or <i>The Cornhill</i>, you will have some
good examples of the graphic art of that time. Fred
Walker made most of the illustrations for Thackeray’s
books, after the author had been compelled
to admit he had failed as an illustrator.

illustrated. All the designs were drawn in sepia or

you can find anything in Japanese art more perfect
than that bowl and jar. They are perfect. There is
not one single bit of work which is not perfect, and
it is one of the great examples of modern illustration.
There is not a bit of shadow or tone; it is all
pure drawing, and it expresses everything about the
objects.

in which he worked with a pencil and pen on the
block. There are four or five drawings, not engraved,
by him now in the Library of Congress in Washington,
soon to be on exhibition.

One of the great developments in illustration
was the publication of the London <i>Graphic</i>, which
was started in 1869. This drawing is by a man
named W. M. Ridley, who is scarcely known, but
if all his drawings could only be published again
today he would be known as a very great artist.
To the early numbers of <i>The Graphic</i>, Herkomer,

artists contributed drawings which made their
reputations.

One thing that happened at this time was the
relief of the artist from the drudgery of drawing
on the block. Every one of the engravings I have
shown you was first drawn on the wood block,
and every one of them cut to pieces, and the artist
had no redress whatever if the engraver spoiled the
drawing in engraving. But someone, somewhere,
about 1875, conceived the idea of photographing
the drawing made on paper on to the wood and
engraving it. The consequence was that the drawing
was preserved, and if it was a portrait of a place
the artist did not have to reverse it on the wood.
If the engraver went wrong he could not blame the
artist, as he did before; the engraver got the blame,

Thirty years ago triumphs in illustration and
engraving were produced in this country in the
// 067.png
.pn 50
magazines of the years between 1880 and 1900, and
the greatest of wood engravers were Americans.
Timothy Cole is regarded as a master-engraver;
so were Henry Wolf and Jüngling. Cole’s prints
were published in <i>The Century Magazine</i>. If you
want to know something about the arts of illustration
and engraving, look over <i>The Century Magazine</i>,
<i>Harper’s</i> and <i>Scribner’s</i>, and see what was
done then in the graphic arts from 1880 to 1900.
We have had during the last half-century some of
the greatest designers, some of the greatest engravers,
and the greatest printers, and the greatest art
editors of modern times. Abbey, Cole, De Vinne,
Drake—how many of you know their names?
And their work appeared in the pages of those
magazines. The magazines are still being published,
but I do not think you will find in any number
today any wood cut or wood engraving like
this by Abbey or the engraving by Cole (Page 52).

In the next lecture I shall show you how we
have gone forward and gone backward, but at that
time there issued a series of masterpieces from those
magazines, and it is your duty as students to study
them and to study the illustrated books that I have
shown you. Will you? I doubt it.

Abbey made his name by illustrating <i>Herrick’s
Poems</i>. You can find any number of faults in this
design, yet it made a sensation at that time. But
Abbey went on and on, and some of the designs
in that edition of Herrick are among the best things
that he did. They were all drawn for the wood
engraver, and probably some of the earliest were
drawn on the wood block.

I have brought you up to the present, and I think
I have proved to you that in the past, in the graphic

arts, there was great work done, but in the present,
in certain places, equally great work was done till
the war; but little that is good is now being done in
this country or any country, and it is up to you
students to study and to practice and demand to be
taught how to do it, and then to go to work and do
something better than the work of the past. Will
you? You have the chance, even to convert the
editors and engravers and printers again to do good
work, but you must put your hearts and your hands—your
properly trained and skilled hands—into your
work, or America artistically is doomed. The future
is in your hands. Will you carry on tradition or go
down in the mad race for money—a race in which
the runners are drawing near the goal? Americans
are about two laps behind the leaders, and we
are too blind, too stupid, too lazy, too conceited,
to know what the rest of the world knows.

In the first lecture I tried to tell you something
about the beginnings of illustration. I want to
speak today of its modern developments. But
before I do, I would like to say that, if there is
any statement I make that you do not understand,
I wish you would ask me about it, or write me, and
I will try to make my meaning clear. But no
matter how much I talk, or what I say, unless you
are willing to do your part and look things up, and
then work with the facts you have acquired—well,
I don’t think you will learn very much, or do anything
of much importance, for without the hardest

There is another sort of work, another phase of
art, which has been made great and good use of
during the last years by illustrators, and that is the
work of the Japanese—the Japanese color print.
It is the custom today in this country, and in
European countries, to make much of the Japanese
color print. The Japanese color print was never
appreciated in Japan by any but the people, any
more than the illustrations in the books of yesterday
were appreciated by any of the artists of this country,
and it is only because a few European artists saw the
beauty of the works of Hiroshige, Hokusai, Utamaro,
and other great artists, that the Japanese themselves
began to find they were beautiful. Here the
people do not yet appreciate what we have done
in illustration. The Japanese illustrators were very
little better appreciated than the pavement artists
who used to decorate our streets before we got bill-*stickers
to do our decoration, but there was in Japanese
work wonderful charm and wonderful technique.
So there was in American illustration. Prints by
Hokusai, in black and white, are perfect as models of
design for printing. It was in prints like these that
Whistler found his Nocturnes. He said when he saw
Hiroshige’s Falling Rocket (Page 57), it gave him
the idea for the Nocturnes, and he, inspired by that
print, made his paintings and his drawings after the
Japanese fashion, only carrying out the traditions of
the East in the West.

the color print in line, in form, and above all, in
method, is the simplest and most direct way of
making a printing surface that we know, and a great
deal that we now know and a great many of the
improvements in engraving and printing that have
been made are due to the Japanese.

Take this study of a bird (Page 61). Nothing
could be more simple and more direct. And yet it
probably was used in the most commonplace of
books, or as a single print, but it has been an inspiration
to many Europeans. And here is an example
of it in the work of an Englishman, Edgar Wilson
(Page 62), who, following the Japanese methods
and using the pen at the same time, instead of
drawing with the brush on the wood block in which
the design was afterward cut and printed, carried on
the tradition of Japanese art in our way and by our
technique. Bracquemond, Felix Regamy, and many
other European decorators owe an endless debt to
Japan.

They are by no means alone; here is another
man who used the Japanese formula. You can
find in some of the sketch books of Hokusai, and
other Japanese masters, drawings of birds like this.
Yet this design was reproduced on the title-page of
a French edition of Poe’s <i>Raven</i>. It is by Manet
(Page 63), a proof that as soon as Europeans saw
Japanese prints, they took advantage of Japanese
methods. The Japanese artists have also shown
the world in their prints the way in which the work
was done. Here is a wood cutter at work holding
his knife vertically in his hands, cutting the design
on the block (Page 55). I do not know the date
of this print or the name of the artist, but this
is the traditional system, and it is because the
// 077.png
.pn 60
Japanese artists follow tradition that their work is
good, and we have not in any way been able to
improve on it.

Anyone who wants to make a color print, instead
of commencing by making a very bad oil painting, or
a worthless water color, should commence by making
a drawing in black and white; that is the basis
of the whole system—that is the way the Japanese
commence. When they have made their design
on paper in black and white, they paste it down on
a wood block, and the engraver cuts through the
paper into the block, cutting the design all to
pieces, as that man is doing with his knife. When
that was done the next thing was to put on the color,
and instead of making, as the European artist usually
does, a very bad oil painting or a worthless water
color and trying to copy that by lithography or
color process, they cut as many blocks as colors,
mix the colors themselves and put them on, one
after the other, one color from one block. It is
utterly impossible to get color by any other method.
Nearly all our books and magazines today are
illustrated by what is known as “the three-color
process.” You can see the result on the cover of
every magazine, almost, that comes out, and the
only difference between them is that sometimes
one is rather worse than the others. They are
nearly all devoid of every merit, and they are all
the most popular in the American world. They
are mechanical photographic travesties of artless,
worthless paintings mostly.

are certain men at work, and others have been
doing good color work for years. Here is one of
the earliest examples, a design by Walter Crane,
though this was not done in the Japanese way.
Crane made the drawing in black and white, then
it was engraved on the wood block, and he added the
colors he wanted. The wood blocks were engraved
by an English engraver, Edmund Evans (Page 64),
and as many blocks were made as colors were
wanted, and they were applied just as the Japanese
did, only with this difference, that they were printed
on a steam press and in this way Crane’s and Caldecott’s
toy books were made. We have advanced
to the extent of using the steam press, instead of
rubbing the print off the inked block, or using the
wooden press. But that is the only advance we
have made. The best color work is not even now
done on a steam press, but by hand printing.

AND FINISHED PRINT

Morley Fletcher has studied most carefully the
work of the oriental artists and craftsmen, and has
succeeded in doing a series of blocks which in their
way equal those of the Japanese. Yet his attitude
is the European attitude; it is putting the feeling
of the country around him, England, into his blocks.
He has not in any way tried to imitate Japanese
subjects or to make copies of them, but he has
carried out the feeling of the English country, and
of other European countries, in his color prints made
as the Japanese make their prints. He cut the key
block from which he made the print in black and
white (Page 64). The other blocks, made afterward,
carried the different colors. You can see how every
line has been carefully drawn, and how carefully
the undrawn spaces are cut out, leaving the design
in relief. After that block was made there were as
// 083.png
.pn 66
many others cut as there were colors, and one was
printed after the other, not on top of each other,
but side by side, as a mosaic is made. And it is in
this way alone that good color work can be done.
Yet such printing can be done on a steam press,
and can be done very rapidly, though the best work
is, and always will be, done by hand.

Here in Chicago you had a very interesting
woman, Helen Hyde, who died recently, and whose
work is going to be shown, I believe, shortly in the
Museum. Her work technically was brilliant, but a
great many of her subjects were frankly imitative
of the Japanese in subject as well as technique.
There is no earthly reason why those of you who
care for drawing and for color should not carry
out this scheme of color printing. But, as I will
show you in the talk on Lithography, there are
simpler ways of doing color work, and even men
like Morley Fletcher and other color printers are
giving up using wood blocks, and beginning the use
of stone and metal plates instead, because the
work can be done in a simpler manner than by
the slow and elaborate cutting of each block. Yet
the grain of the wood gives a most interesting
quality, and so does hand printing.

Emil Orlik (Page 67) has carried out the same
scheme of color printing. He holds the same position
on the continent of Europe, in Germany and
Austria—or did before the war—that Morley Fletcher
has in England. Scarcely any of the work of these
men is known well over here, but it deserves to be
well known. You can find some examples of it in
the Ryerson Library, mostly in reproductions in the

it is your duty to study the books which contain it.

Mr. Baumann, who has been living until recently
in Chicago, also makes color prints (Page 68). He
has found that the landscape of America is just as
well adapted to the color print as that of Europe,
and the proof of the fact that a man is an artist is
the fact that he can find beauty and find subjects
around him, and then make something out of what
he finds. Mr. Ruzicka has done so in New York.
There is no necessity for harking back to the past
ages. And I can assure you, although I have not
had the experience, but I know from what I have
seen, that it is a great deal easier to invent a
Heavenly Host than it is to make a good print out
of a Kansas farm.

AND WASH REPRODUCED BY PROCESS, J. B. LIPPINCOTT CO.

Now, showing how this work can be carried out—and
I said it could be done by means of the steam
press and mechanical appliances—a good example is
in the work of Arthur Rackham (Page 69). He has
adapted the methods of the Japanese to photo-engraving
and mechanical engraving. His designs
are made with a pen, in black and white. The colors
are selected by Rackham and given to the photo-engravers,
who put them on just where he wants
them. But Rackham is a trained craftsman and
knows what colors to use and how to use them. As I
said in the last talk, you have to stand over the
printers, you have to make them work with you
and for you. And if you don’t, and you get into a
mess, it is because you are not trained. But you
are going to be blamed if you fail, if you don’t
know your craft. You have to be trained to do
this work as Rackham is trained. I have been with
him in England when he has gone into the printing
// 089.png

shop, and has taken off his coat and rolled up his
sleeves and shown the printers what he wants and
how he wants it done, and if he didn’t know himself
and couldn’t have shown them, he would have been
kicked out of that place pretty quickly. He would
not even be an illustrator.

Jules Guerin carried out extremely well so long
as he condescended to illustrate by the Japanese
method of flat color, and yet gave to his subjects a
remarkable sense of realism. His drawings for the
city-planning scheme of Chicago and studies of other
cities and architecture are most interesting. In
figure work, too, Jessie Willcox Smith and Elizabeth
Shippen Green started well—with a Bryn Mawr
catalogue or calendar—but in their later work they
have become more realistic—though I do not think
they are so real.

Another artist who has done the same sort of
work in an equally interesting fashion is William
Nicholson (Page 70). He designed the illustrations
and lettered the title-page and cover of <i>London Types</i>.
These designs were first printed from wood blocks
which he cut, but as the book was printed in a large
edition it was impossible for him to do the printing
himself, so he had copies made and printed by lithography
instead of from the original wood blocks. But
the design shows how well Nicholson understands
the requirements and needs of color printing. He
understands that as well as anybody now living.
His posters and those of his fellow-workman James
Pryde—they called themselves the Beggerstaff
Brothers—are equally interesting.

blocks. I think it probable that he made this study
of Notre Dame from nature on the wood block,
and then engraved it. In it you have the perfection
of original wood engraving, the perfection in European
engraving, and of what the Japanese have been
doing in their way for hundreds of years. There are
numbers of other men who have been working; one
is F. Valloton (Page 74), and he has simplified things
more. I don’t think it would be possible to get
simpler, fewer lines and masses than he. He has cut
a number of wood blocks, and every one is well
worth study. I want to say, however, that we have
in this country now got beyond all this thing, far
beyond traditional art—far beyond all art. We
have become artless but crafty.

Here are a couple of illustrations taken from a
paper which used to be a credit to the city of
Chicago. Now it is a discredit to the city of New
York. The print this side of the slide is, as you
see, from a Japanese block; the print on the other
side is an American design. If you prefer that—each
one of them is equally simple—to the drawing
of this figure, well, all I can say is, you can
do so. And that sort of work is growing in this
country, and is used at the present day, and being
more and more used. It is only an excuse for
incompetence, laziness, and inability, to avoid the
trouble, skill, and time necessary to do anything
decently—provided you can do it decently. It
may be the fashion of the moment, but it is only
of the moment, and will not, like this Japanese
print, live forever, as it has lived for a couple of
hundred years. The other may make a little
splutter for a moment, but it will not go on living
and growing and be more and more appreciated for
// 095.png

all time. It is so easy to do a drawing of this sort.
The perpetrator will tell you he did it the way he
saw it—I mean the American print. That is a
way of getting out of all difficulties, but it is not
a way to become an artist. And no man who takes
up the slovenly, slipshod, get-there-any-way-you-can
method, is ever going to get anywhere at all.
You can take my word for it or not, but I know I
am telling you the truth, and as one eminent artist
said on looking at drawings like this, or rather, looking
at the same sort of paintings: “You can tell
exactly what great artists like Velasquez or Franz
Hals or Rembrandt meant when they painted a
subject, but you cannot tell how they painted it.
If you look at this modern work you can tell how it
was done, but I will be hanged if you can tell what
the duffer meant by doing it.”

Rockwell Kent (Page 75) has followed Blake technically
in a way, yet for himself, though drawing on
paper, and his drawings are reproduced mechanically
and not as Blake’s were by metal or wood engraving,
and Kent is trying, really seriously I hope, to
carry on the tradition of Blake in those drawings
which I showed you the other day. Kent has
found Blake-like subjects in Alaska, but I wish he
could find motives—and there are subjects quite as
interesting and as good, and as romantic in the
streets of New York, just as Blake got his inspiration
in his little garden near the Temple in London;
and I think if Kent found them somewhere
on the East Side, it would be more to his credit,
though his work is very interesting and reproduces
very well.

But to turn from original wood cutting and wood
engraving to another phase of illustration, there is a
// 096.png
.pn 79
new phase, as I told you last week, since the application
of photography to wood engraving, enabling
the artist to make his drawing on paper, have it
photographed on to the block, and then engraved.
When this was done a great advance in the arts was
made.

But about 1880 a still greater advance was made.
It was discovered that if a drawing were photographed
on to a zinc or other metal plate, the undrawn
parts washed away, and the drawing covered
by an acid-resisting varnish in the form of ink,
it could then be etched mechanically instead of
engraved by hand. The photograph was covered
by this acid-resisting ink, then slightly bitten with
nitric acid, then the plate was heated and the
varnish melted and ran down the sides of the lines,
and not only protected their surface but their sides,
and in that way a mechanically etched block was
made, the design in relief, which can be printed
with type, exactly like a wood cut or a wood engraving
in relief—exactly as Blake had done, yet a perfect
facsimile of the original drawing, a reproduction of
the drawing as a printing surface. It is a very
curious thing that, although this is one of the very
first mechanical engravings done in France after
Fortuny (Page 76), it is as perfect in its technical
execution as anything that has been done in the
same way to this day.

forty years ago in France and here. Always in the
history of the world, when a new method of work
is discovered, brilliant men capable of employing it
have appeared. Martin Rico (Page 81), a landscape
and townscape artist, found himself in pen drawing.
He used the pen for the rendering of architecture
and one of the most interesting things about his
work is the directness and simplicity with which
Rico got his effect, and the economy and beauty of
his lines. There is not a single line wasted, and
yet he got all the shimmer and the glitter of the
summer sun in Venice. He suggests, too, the forms
of the architecture, rather than draws them—suggests
them by shadows which give the form. He
is one of the masters of drawing for reproduction,
for it is the reproduction of the drawing on the
printed page which is the illustration.

Shortly afterward another Spaniard appeared—Daniel
Vierge (Page 82). Both Fortuny and Rico
were Spaniards, and the best work was done in illustration
for mechanical engraving in the beginning by
Spaniards. Vierge carried this system of drawing
for mechanical engraving farther than anyone else,
and carried it out more perfectly. Look at the
way each one of his lines tells just as effectively as
in the old wood cuts. Vierge’s fame rests on the
pages of <i>Pablo de Segovia</i>, the most perfect book
and one of the first books illustrated by pen drawings
reproduced by mechanical process engraving, and
still one of the best. Vierge treated all sorts of
subjects in this volume—figure, landscape, still
life, decoration—and he tried all sorts of experiments
in technique, always remembering and
knowing that an illustrator must be a brilliant
technical craftsman, as all great artists have been.

A duffer may do stupid, clumsy work because he
“sees that way”; an artist never does.

How wonderfully Vierge could draw architecture,
and yet with simplicity and directness, so that he kept
the sunlight in his drawings. They were so handled
that they reproduced perfectly, and they could
not be better printed today, mostly not so well.
Yet that book appeared in a very small edition about
1880. It is now regarded as a masterpiece, and
the greatest example of pen drawing and reproduction
that exists, a mine of information for you
students.

The success of Vierge’s books and the reproductions
after Fortuny became known in this country,
and in the early 80’s Robert Blum (Page 83), Alfred
Brennan (Page 84), and Fernand Lungren began to
follow this Spanish method of drawing. This study
of Joe Jefferson by Robert Blum was published in
<i>The Century</i>. In it you have an extraordinary
quality of pen line which you very rarely see, you
never see, in our magazines today. There is no man
in the world drawing as Blum did, nor are there any
such engravers and printers now, because there are
few intelligent art editors, and fewer intelligent
art lovers, otherwise we would not have to see the
rubbish we do see. You will find those wonderful
illustrations, many of them portraits like this, and
prints of all sorts, in old numbers of <i>The Century</i>
and <i>Scribner’s</i> and <i>Harper’s</i>. And just as I told
you about the old numbers of <i>Once a Week</i> and
<i>Good Words</i>, I want to drum into your heads that
there is a mine of material worth study in every
volume of <i>The Century</i> between about 1880 and
1900, and you ought to study these illustrations
and try to learn from them.
// 103.png
.pn 86

There is, however, one thing you must remember,
that the drawings you see in these magazines are
all reduced. They were all reduced, or nearly all
of them, by photography, and that gives them a
look of refinement and delicacy which did not altogether
exist in the originals. But Blum thought
about the final print on the page as much as the
drawing he was making, and how he was to get his
results, and this only comes by endless practice
and endless observation of other men’s drawn and
printed work. In that he was only carrying on
tradition, and if you don’t want to carry on tradition,
if you don’t try to do better work than everyone
who has gone before you, well, as Whistler was wont
to say, if tradition had not been carried on, “even
the early Britons wouldn’t have known how to paint
themselves blue.”

Blum has treated architecture just as Rico did,
and this design is taken from a catalogue of a
hotel in Florida, and is as fine as anything he ever did,
a proof that advertisements may be artistic—if kept
from the advertising man. And yet this is nothing
but an advertisement, an advertisement done by an
artist who considered that illustrating and advertising
were as serious as any other form of art.

And now I come to an entirely different sort of
work, yet done by, I think you will admit, probably
the greatest illustrator that we have had, E. A.
Abbey. In this design there is no attempt at
getting brilliancy of sunlight, or any such effects,
but an attempt to reconstruct, as in this drawing for
<i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, the life of England in the
past. Abbey considered illustration just as seriously
as his painting or his decoration. And even if his
decorations and his paintings were wiped out, he
// 104.png
.pn 87
would be remembered forever by the charming
illustrations that he made for <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>,
and the books in which they afterward appeared.

REPRODUCED BY PROCESS. LOANED BY THE ARTIST

Here is another one from Goldsmith, showing
better, I think, than the last the actual pen work and
the handling. And although it looks freely done, it
is carefully thought out and carefully carried out.
It was commenced with a lead pencil, and then gone
over with ink—most of these men made a pencil
drawing first and then went over that with a pen.
Abbey said to me once—and I believe it is true of
all great artists—that he never touched pencil to
paper until he saw the whole design completed
before him on the blank sheet of paper. He got the
whole thing in his head, and had it there before he
commenced to work. But I can tell you, he didn’t do
it out of his head, for that man never drew anything
without a model. He hunted the whole of England
over for those chairs and tables in the drawing. If
there was a bit of detail or anything of that sort he
wanted, even though it should be in the remotest
part of Europe, he never hesitated to go and get it,
or get somebody to get it for him, and put it in as a
tiny detail in one of his illustrations to make that
drawing right. But as he said, illustration is just as
serious as any other form of art, only now it is not
so regarded. Working with Abbey was an Englishman,
Alfred Parsons (Page 89), who designed nearly
all the frontispieces and head- and tail-pieces, and
drew the landscapes, in Abbey’s books. Here is the
title-page from one of these books which shows how
brilliantly Parsons could render decoration. But
he did not confine himself to that, for here is one of
his drawings from nature, a little tail-piece, carried
out with the utmost perfection, and carried out in
// 105.png
.pn 88
a way that has never been surpassed. Although
Parsons was known all over the world years before
he began to paint, and though it was not until he
did paint that he became a member of the Royal
Academy and other societies, yet he, too, like
Abbey, will live by his black-and-white illustrations.

THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO

William Morris, a little later, determined to
resurrect the work of the past. His idea, and that
of the pre-Raphaelites, was that everything after
the time of Raphael was worthless, and he went
back to the earliest designing and the earliest
printing. And he endeavored, and succeeded from
his point of view, in making decorated books which
have never been surpassed in modern times and
probably never will be equaled again. He also
designed and had his type cut and cast, made
initials and borders, and almost ruined the whole
with his awful stops which disfigure the pages. He
set the whole up, and printed his books on hand
presses, basing his work on that of the early Venetian
printers of the fifteenth century, printing a notable
series of volumes by the methods of the early
printers. The most complete, the most important
of all is his <i>Chaucer</i> (Page 90). The decorations were
designed by Morris, and the drawings are said to
have been done by Burne-Jones. They were not.
They were by two of his pupils and friends, Fairfax
Murray and Catterson Smith, but all the same the
book is beautiful, and the illustrations were engraved
on wood by W. H. Hooper, who had engraved
the men of the 60’s. There are certain things that
we may not like about Morris’ work, but I want
to tell you that Morris carried out his ideas by
the methods of the early printers and the early
designers. He took very little advantage of what
// 106.png



// 107.png



// 108.png
.pn 91
has been done since. And others have followed in
his steps mostly without his success, because they
are without his knowledge, gained by a lifetime of
experiment and experience.

Morris’ books were printed in his little shop in
Hammersmith (Page 93), and you can see the sheets
in front of the press and the two men working
in the same way that the printers of Venice worked
three or four hundred years before. He believed
that was the right way, the only way to do good
work. Some of us think it was not, and that work
can be done as well by taking advantage of our
present methods and so carrying on tradition.

There were two men, however, who still clung,
and very firmly, to the Morris tradition. Charles
Ricketts and Charles Shannon were two artists who
worked together, and in their illustrations, type,
printing, and binding issued many volumes from the
Vale Press, which was run by Ballantyne of London,
from which came a notable series. They designed
their type, made the drawings and cut them, and they
did it surprisingly well. They also made and issued
<i>The Dial</i>, the most notable English artists’ journal.

There are a number of other designers and
printers in England—Pissarro, the son of the painter
Pissarro, and James Guthrie. There are other
craftsmen now all over the world, but if you don’t
know how to do your own work, it won’t get done.
Guthrie, at the Pear Tree Press, is doing good work,
much of it in the manner of Blake.

.ca PAGE 91 HOWARD PYLE: TITLE AND ILLUSTRATION\
FROM “ROBIN HOOD”

There are other artists who believe there are
other ways of working, and one of them was Howard
Pyle. Pyle believed that the way the artists of
today should work was to take advantage of modern
methods. And he designed his edition of <i>Robin Hood</i>
// 109.png
.pn 92
(Page 93) from end to end himself, yet instead of the
illustrations being cut on wood laboriously by hand
they were sent to the photo-engraver and engraved
mechanically in the same way the work of Vierge
was engraved. He used good type, he spaced his
type well, and he arranged his illustrations on the
page well; he drew not only the decorative head- and
tail-pieces, but the full pages and the cover,
and he also wrote the story. And that book made
an enormous sensation when it came out here, and
even impressed greatly the very conservative William
Morris, who thought up to that time, 1883, nothing
good artistically could come out of America. But
Pyle succeeded and produced several other volumes
by which he made an international reputation.
At the last, however, he became a mere hack, and,
dying, regretted it. In other of his books you can
see how carefully, in fact, too carefully, he resurrected
the past. In <i>Otto of the Silver Hand</i> he told
and illustrated a German story of the Middle Ages.
The drawings were made in pen and ink, photographed
on to metal plates, and mechanically engraved,
not cut on wood; and that is the way he
carried on tradition, the way all the work that I now
have to show you has been done, the way we are
doing today, and the right way to carry on.

I showed you a few moments ago one of Morris’
presses. This is a modern machine (Page 128) that
you must encounter, that you have got to tackle and
conquer if you want to become really successful
illustrators, engravers, printers. This is the sort of
monster on which illustrated books and magazines
are printed today.

But you have got to master it, and until the
Art Institute of Chicago begins to run a printing
establishment, and makes you art students who want
to learn illustration take that practical course, you
are going to have a pretty bad time when you get
out in the world and encounter the engravers and
printers who want practical workmen and not
untrained artists. You can see what a terrible
monster the press is, and it is a very difficult thing
to subdue, and I tell you that you must be its
master. You cannot tinker with it, you will not be
allowed to tinker with it, because if anything goes
wrong with the press you will spoil thousands of
dollars’ worth of work, and you have got to know it
before you will be allowed to work for it or with it.
But it is your duty, in fact the duty of the directors
of this school, to start practical training, and unless
you have this training, and until you can use what
you think is your wonderful ability, your wonderful
ideas practically, you will not be of much use in this
work. And that is the trouble with the people in
the United States; we know everything except how
little we do know practically. We are as unprepared
in art as we were in war.

This scheme of carrying on mechanically the old
methods is shown perfectly in these two designs.
One is by Dürer, drawn and cut on wood, and the
other a pen drawing mechanically reproduced by a
// 113.png
.pn 96
modern German, Sattler. He has studied drawing,
engraving, and printing, old and new, and knows
the whole craft down to the ground. And that is
what we Americans have got to learn if we want to
do better work than foreigners.

WASH DRAWING REPRODUCED BY PROCESS

Here is another design by Sattler (Page 97), one
of the most brilliant of his drawings, done with a
splendid command of the pen and the brush. Probably
that figure was put in with the brush, a solid
black, and the rest with the pen. But see how wonderfully
the thing is done; an old theme, but it is
carried out in a new way, by modern methods, and
that is what you must learn to do.

Here is still another German design by Otto
Greiner. I don’t like the mixture of decoration and
realism which is in that page, but still it is pretty
well put together in its way, and marvelously drawn,
engraved, and printed. Greiner was killed early in
the war.

Many Englishmen have followed in the footsteps
of Morris. Herbert Horne was one. This is a page
from an early magazine, <i>The Hobby Horse</i>. This
shows how, with a pen and a brush, you can get
richness of color in a manner that the old men knew
nothing about, and it is all done with a pen, and
mechanically reproduced.

Other forms of book illustrations have been
carried out. In Birmingham, under the influence
of Morris, several very brilliant men appeared,
among them, E. H. New; he was a young man at
that time, but is not so young now. He applied
that old German method to modern pen drawing,
and in a series of portraits like this and in book
plates he made a reputation. He is now, and has
been for years, making a series of drawings of the

colleges of Oxford, in what is called the Loggan
manner, bird’s-eye views; and he has made them
into designs which are quite as fine and quite as
decorative as anything that was done by Hollar or
Loggan or any of the old engravers who worked
in this way. You see how stunningly the portrait
is drawn. I admit that it is hard and conventional,
but still it is decorative, and is very good work and
prints well, and that is the end of illustration.
F. E. Griggs has also done much good work somewhat
in this way.

.ca PAGE 99 AUBREY BEARDSLEY: ILLUSTRATION FOR “MORTE\
D’ARTHUR.” PEN DRAWING

There came a time when a certain young man
thought he could go quite a bit farther than Morris
and Pyle, and that boy, about nineteen years old
when he made his first important drawing, was
Aubrey Beardsley. He believed at that time in
Morris’ work, but not in Morris’ methods. In the
design for his edition of the <i>Morte d’Arthur</i> (Page 98),
he carried out all the old feeling in the decoration and
the figure drawing, and it was perfectly proper in the
subject that he should do so. His drawings were
done with a pen and reproduced mechanically by
Carl Henschel, also an experimenter, and yet he
got results in his published work quite equal to
anything that Morris had done. But Beardsley
was a man who was not contented with doing only
one thing, and during the four or five years that he
was working he was always doing something new,
and by different methods. In some he used certain
Japanese formulas, in others old Italian, and he went
on and on doing more wonderful work until it
culminated in a series of designs for <i>The Rape of the
Lock</i>, one of the most perfect of modern books.

I shall never forget one night when Beardsley
was in my place in London, and Whistler came
// 117.png
.pn 100
in, and Whistler had never liked Beardsley, and
Beardsley knew it. He was one of the most sensitive
creatures that ever lived. He always carried a
portfolio containing some of his work around with
him, and when Whistler came in, Beardsley opened
the portfolio and showed him his drawings. Whistler
looked bored, but he showed him this one, among
others, and Whistler looked at the drawing, and
said, “Aubrey, do you know I have made a mistake.
I didn’t believe in you, but I know now that
you are a very great artist.” And the boy burst out
crying. That was the type of man Whistler was.
You have heard many things said about him; you
have heard many things said against him. But I
wish to say that he was the most devoted friend, and
a most sincere critic, and most generous to artists
whom he believed in and knew were doing something
worth while, something that was worth doing;
and he knew from that time that Aubrey Beardsley
was the greatest designer England had in modern
times. Those were almost his last words to Beardsley,
for this was just before his fatal illness was
coming on him, and Beardsley went from the success
of his work to the south of France to die. The lives
of two men, Keats and Beardsley, are almost
identical. Both of them will live, one in literature
and the other in art, forever, and both were killed
by criticism—the spite of the little toward the
great.

Anning Bell (Page 102) is another Englishman
who, in a series of children’s books, one of which is
the story of Jack the Giant-Killer, from which this
is taken, did some fine work. There you see the use
of simple pen lines in contrast with great masses of
brush work. And again I want to call your attention
to the importance of being able to make your
masses tell, and to make them in such a way that they
will print. That is what is wanted—not only to get
drawings that will look well on paper as drawings,
but you have got to make drawings so that the
mechanical engraver or the wood engraver can engrave
them, and the printing press will print them.
It is not the drawing you make that counts, but it
is the print that counts. It is the printed page
which is seen. The people may not like it. That
does not matter. But what does matter to you is
that you have got to draw it so your work will
print, and then the people can go hang. You
should not work for the people, but for yourselves,
but you must know how to work.

I have not shown you any drawings, scarcely,
in wash, for this reason. If you make a wash drawing,
you make it just as you make any other
wash drawing, but there are certain things to be
learned. No wash drawing has ever been printed
perfectly. I do not believe one ever will be. The
print seems pretty good until you see the original,
and then you come suddenly to the conclusion that
it is usually pretty bad. But pen drawings can be
perfectly facsimiled. Wash drawings cannot, yet
they are used everywhere today.

Now we will turn to another sort of work, the
work of the comic artist. Though you might not
have thought so, there was more fun among the
Germans—at least before the war, I don’t think
there is much now—there was more sense of humor
among those people than anywhere else, and not
only that, they knew how to make funny drawings
that would print, and William Busch, in his
endless comics published in <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, and
other papers, did know how to make drawings of
this kind. How many of the artists on our papers
know how to make drawings which are comic—or
even artistic? Compare drawings like that
with such as appeared in <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> this

Forain is a great French comic or satiric artist.
He has made endless drawings for the <i>Figaro</i> and
other French papers. There are an endless number of
men we look at for their humor and their art—they
want no legend to explain them—in every country all
over the world, there are men who possess this power,
except in this country. We have scarcely one real
comic artist, one cartoonist. There is one, and he
is Arthur Frost (Page 105). His technique is not
good. It is, in comparison with that of the foreigners,
very poor. But there is something expressive about
his facts and fancies that the so-called American
caricaturist doesn’t understand and cannot approach,
or come anywhere near. There is not a single man
in the United States of America who can make a
drawing like Frost’s, though W. A. Rogers is very
good indeed, yet every newspaper in the country
has a cartoonist, and a funny man, but does anyone
laugh at a funny drawing in the newspapers? You
weep for a people who can stand such rot.

An American who has had a wonderful success is
Charles Dana Gibson. But unfortunately Mr. Gibson
devoted himself to one sort of subject. He has
succeeded in that, but he seems to have tired
of it. He certainly did, with his Gibson Girl, make
some very charming studies, but I have no use
myself for his political work, and I think that if
Mr. Gibson had confined himself to his Girl, he
would be a great deal better known today artistically,
and have a considerably higher artistic position
than he has. I think there are many people who
can do political caricatures as well as he can, but
I don’t think there is anyone who has been so successful
as he has with charming young persons, and
he has drawn them charmingly. He has endless imitators,
and imitation is the source of success today.
Gibson, too, knows his craft.

W. G. Baxter, an Englishman, was a great comic
artist. Nobody in this country has ever been
able to make a design like this. The character is
marvelous. Nobody here has rendered that in the
way that Baxter has. And yet it was published in
a very vulgar comic paper, <i>Ally Sloper’s Half-Holiday</i>.
But is there anything among the comic
drawings, such as “The Gumps,” or “Bringing up
Father,” or anything of that sort, which disgrace
the American press today, that comes anywhere
near it? If there is, I would like to see it. But
I cannot find it, nor can you. The American comic
artist would be pathetic, if he were not a disgrace.

Another Englishman was Phil May (Page 106),
and he was as great an artist as Charles Keene, whose
work I showed you in the last lecture. May really
cared for comic art, and succeeded in doing a very
remarkable series of designs in <i>Punch</i>. He was one
// 125.png
.pn 108
of the two or three artists ever on that paper. His
drawings look as though they were knocked right off.
They were nothing of the sort. That drawing I
know, because I saw him make a part of it, was
drawn again and again. The face is a wonderful
study. His great aim was to simplify and simplify.
And although anyone who saw his work might think
his first attempt as near perfect as it could be, yet
he would lay a sheet of thin tracing paper over the
apparently finished drawing, and go over each line,
here and there leaving out one or two, or adding
another, and I have known him to do that several
times before he was satisfied. He, too, regarded
illustration as seriously as any other form of art,
and that is the reason why he became a great artist.

In Holland and Belgium there are a certain
number of men who have taken up the profession
very brilliantly and in their own way. This study
of the Dutch street is notable, giving the Dutch
feeling and character as well as De Hoogh could
paint it, and it proves that nationality can be given
to art and to illustration.

He does not confine himself to this sort of work
alone, but has illustrated books as diverse as <i>Omar

and a perfect knowledge of how to work for reproduction.
He is one of the men who has been carefully

ARTIST

An artist in this country who is doing very good
work in charcoal is F. Walter Taylor. This drawing
(Page 111) is taken from a recent number of
<i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, so it proves very plainly, though
there is mighty little good work being done, there
are some men, a few in this country, who are
trying to carry on, in the right spirit by the right
methods, and find that certain editors will acknowledge
they are right and accept their work.

Taylor also does excellent portraits. I don’t think
you have seen anything I have shown that is more
// 127.png
.pn 110
stunning than this charcoal portrait (Page 127) which
he intends to publish in some newspaper or magazine.
It is perfectly done, and yet it is done by an illustrator
who is hardly known in his country, and outside
of it, scarcely at all. And yet he is a very great
artist. Why do not the American people have their
portraits drawn instead of being photographed? Possibly
it is quicker and cheaper; those are our ideals.

The Institute possesses a number of charcoal
drawings by F. Hopkinson Smith, which are well
worth study, for Hopkinson Smith was an interesting
technician and understood drawing for the press,
invented it so far as charcoal drawing is concerned.
I must say I never saw a pupil studying those upstairs,
or even looking at them.

And there is another thing a propos of pen drawing.
I believe that the rage for the reproduction of
bad oil paintings and worse water colors is drawing
to its close. Take up any of the magazines of
enlightenment and public opinion, which circulate
by the millions in this country today, which the
average reader picks up, commencing at the back,
spits on his fingers and turns forward to look at the
advertisements, and gradually comes to the illustrations
and the text, and when he gets there
he throws it away! Nobody ever looks in those
magazines for art or literature. They are looked at
for advertisements, and I believe some ladies look
at them for house furnishings and dresses and so on.
But to look at them for art—there is scarce any
art in them. There is no art scarcely in the daily
papers. It is not intended that there should be
any art in them, unless in the advertisements. But
I believe there is coming very shortly a revival
in pen drawing, and through advertising, and that
// 128.png





// 129.png



// 130.png
.pn 113
is one of the reasons why I advise you to study pen
drawing, and if it appeals to you, you may have a
chance of doing something with your work, if you
know how to do it, something to resurrect illustration.

Here is a drawing in wash that is really stunning,
by George Harding, the only man properly
equipped and trained who was sent abroad to study
the war, and the only man who really recorded
the war. He is the one American who made good,
and has made in this design and others a record of
the part we played in the war. He is almost the
only man who did really good work in any country.
Yet every other nation, England, France, and Italy,
sent their best men to do this work. We wanted a
little variety in this program, and we sent some who
made the most commonplace drawings that you
have ever seen; at least some of them did.

Newspaper illustration is another phase, and here
is a design done in the old wood-cut fashion with two
tints, which has been published as a calendar and
is a remarkable example of what can be done by a
man who knows how to do it. The same firm,
the Franklin Printing Company, has issued a
circular in which the ideas of Morris have been
carried out in newspaper work; it is that sort of
thing that we want to do today. It can be done.
The only trouble is that the average art editor
knows nothing about art; the average engraver
knows mighty little, and the average printer doesn’t
care. That is the reason why we are submerged
under the rottenest work that was ever done in this
world. The artists can do good work, but they
don’t have the chance.

forty or fifty proofs of one of his blocks in a day,
those two machines I believe will turn out a hundred

He has been successful, and his technique is now

There are endless ways of drawing for the papers.
Here is another, a very clever drawing done by
an Englishman—and when I say “clever,” I mean

This is one of those things that was printed at the
rate of a hundred thousand copies an hour in the <i>New
York Times</i>, a reproduction of a lithograph made
some years ago (Page 120). They are doing no such
work today in New York, but it is a proof that a
thing done technically right will print, because it
was printed, and it was syndicated, electrotypes or
moulds sent all over the land, and there were several
million copies of it on the same day, in papers published
all over the country.

I am not impressing upon you so much the
artistic side as the technical side of illustration, for
that is most important. Unless you are technically
trained you cannot do technical work, and illustration
is technical.

This is the sort of thing that the American public
now loves. This is the kind of thing we have come
to. And it is going to get worse. I showed this
slide in Washington the other day, and I also had a
paper containing more drawings of the sort, and
after advising the people and telling them what I
thought of that wonderful design, and what I thought
of a nation that could appreciate such pathetic
rubbish, such a disgrace to art, a lady came up to
// 133.png
.pn 116
me after I had concluded, and she said, “Would
you mind giving me that copy of the paper that
you put in your pocket, because I want to take it
home to Sammy, he likes those things so much.”
That is the kind of thing that Sammy is being
brought up on, and when Sammy grows up he will
never get away from it. It is our duty to get Sammy
away from that rot, and to stop papers from printing
that sort of thing, or this country is doomed artistically.
And the only way to stop it is to train
illustrators properly, and to train them to show by
their work that illustration is a serious profession.
It is almost alone in what is known as commercial
art, commercial illustration, that we are doing any
art work of any value—though what sort of art is
there which is not commercial? But it is in advertising
art, to the advertising pages of the magazines
and papers that we must turn today for our
illustration. Americans are become a race of shop-*keepers,
and they believe today they must advertise—tomorrow
they will do some other stunt—but
today it is art in advertising. Most of it is artless—a
hodge-podge of photographs and frills. But there
is some good work done, though you have got to
wade through oceans of rubbish on the back pages
to find it. One phase is that so completely sterilized
and standardized have we become that no sooner
does some artist evolve a style of his own, or rather
a technical mannerism, than a whole horde of imitators
pounce on it.

Lately Mr. Franklin Booth did this, as I have
said. He worked out a combination of white line
and oil paint handling, in pen and ink, which was
amusing and printed well. Instantly a gang of
thieves and prigs and ad men and business men
// 134.png

seized it and did things which they thought just
as good, but which we artists know are rotten,
meaningless, and senseless. This, however, is
true of all American art; we as a nation have
nothing to say for ourselves, so we imitate the
one who has.

There is in this commercial art, however, mostly
no real knowledge of how to draw for rapid printing,
how to draw at all, but some of the designs are very
interesting, though usually ruined by the worst of
lettering or type, which usually cuts right into
them. The fool ad man and the fool business man
are too stupid to know that a work of art, so well
done and so well carried out and printed that one
will want to keep it and will remember the legend
beneath it, will be framed, while the same subject
defaced and disfigured by type and lettering will
be chucked away as only an ad. But the business
man and the ad man have art by the throat; they
know nothing of art, and yet they dump their
notions of it on the people—a people who have
suffered long, but are artless.

There are revivals in art as in other things.
Today the wood cut, the oldest form of illustration,
has been revived, but while in the past both in the
East and West wood cutting was practiced by the
greatest masters, today it is mostly tampered with
by the greatest duffers. Incompetence and ignorance
have taken the place of skill and knowledge
and craftsmanship. Originality among duffers has
momentarily ousted tradition, only the duffers
don’t know that their best work is but a bad imitation
of what was better done centuries ago, or else
they deliberately prig and steal and lie, saying they
never saw what they have stolen. Many are put in
// 139.png
.pn 122
high places, when they should be fined for infringement
of copyright. But critics of art in this country
are still more ignorant, mostly, and we have no
standards of art or morals. Let one man work out
or resurrect something that is interesting—a dozen
immediately copy it. We think we are an inventive,
idealistic nation. We are too often cheap
imitators and low-down thieves.

The wood block or process block can be printed
with letter press, and therefore it is most used today.
The drawing may either be drawn on or photographed
on a plank of cherry or pear wood, or the
cross-section of a piece of boxwood—if any decent
wood has been left by the billboard men. Or it
may when drawn on paper be photographed on to
the wood. Linoleum and thick oilcloth can also
be cut and are much used abroad. The drawing
should be done in one of two ways—either made on
wood or paper in firm lines sufficiently far apart
not to clog up in the printing press, yet not too far,
so as to allow the paper to sag and smear the design,
with pen, pencil, or brush charged with india ink
or some other strong black, for it must be remembered,
first of all, that all lines print equally black—or
should in the press—and that strength of color
in cheap, rapid printing cannot be varied. The
only way in which tone can be got, or different
strength of color, is by making the stronger blacks
with broader lines. Another method of making
wood cuts is to blacken the whole face of the block
and then to draw the design in white upon it with
the graver or knife. You make some very clever
studies in white chalk or color on brown paper
in the schools—they are of no value to print
from. Why don’t the teachers teach you to cut
// 140.png
.pn 123
them in wood, then you might learn something
practical.

Having the design on the block, the wood cutter
should carefully, with a knife or a graver, cut a line
in the wood on each side of the black line or mass,
cutting a simple narrow line to start with, then
with a chisel or gouge dig out the big white spaces
on each side of it. Crosshatching should be avoided
as much as possible, for, though it is easy enough
to draw, the spaces between the crosshatched
lines are very difficult to cut out. Therefore,
not only for printing but for engraving, the lines
and masses should be kept separate and as far
apart as possible. When the block is blacked and
the drawing made in white, the whites are gone
over with a graver, thus cutting them into the
block, and the cut or engraving is thus made in
white lines which will print—as the lines are lowered
and the black surface alone will take the ink. This
is white-line engraving, the method of Bewick.
The black line, cutting the surface away on either
side of the lines, is the method of Dürer and the
Japanese. With sufficient technical skill, white-line
engraving can be done out of doors, as it is
a direct method. As the black block is cut, the
lines may be filled with whiting, and it will look
exactly as it will print.

All American wood engravings of the more
elaborate sort are done in white line on the black
block, though at times both methods are employed
by skilful men on the same block. The English
wood engravings of the sixties were done in the older
way, the black lines drawn on the block left standing.
The drawings were usually done in pencil; if
wash was used, the engraver had to cut it into lines.
// 141.png
.pn 124

But the great thing is to take advantage of and
retain the blacks, making bold strong lines and
leaving big strong forms in black.

In either case study Dürer, the Japanese, and
the work of modern men like Lepère, Valloton,
Nicholson, and Ricketts. Do not be led away
by incompetents and <i>poseurs</i>; clumsiness is not art,
and incompetence is not genius. The greatest works
in any medium were done by the most skilful,
the most highly trained artists, and it is as difficult
for an artist to put down lines the wood cutter or
engraver can follow without having to cut new ones
as it is to cut or engrave. If the artist makes and
cuts his own blocks, he will learn this soon enough—and
if his lines are not good and an engraver does
the cutting, he will learn how bad they are, and the
result will be a shock to him.

The block may either be put on the press, or an
electrotype or stereotype plate made from it and
printed; if some of the fools who make etchings to
be reproduced and printed would try to make wood
blocks, they might find out how bad their work
usually is. But, then, it is much easier to make a
bad etching than a good wood block. For some
reason a bad etching has a great fascination for
ignorant people, who are gravely impressed with it.

Process mechanical engraving has relieved us,
however, of the necessity of cutting or engraving
designs on blocks. There is no question that the
wood with its grain, and the linoleum with its
soft material, give a quality, a depth and richness
to the line and mass that the hard metal plate will
not yield. Note, in any good Japanese print, how
the grain of the wood is taken advantage of, sometimes
making a pattern and aiding the design.
// 142.png
.pn 125
The metal plate is utterly unsympathetic in printing,
but most responsive to any line.

Drawings in line, like wood cuts, can now be made
with any sort of a point, lead pencil, brush, pen, lithographic
chalk, crayon, charcoal; if they are to be
reproduced in line the artist must work on his
sheet of paper with the same care as in making
a drawing for wood cutting. He can crosshatch,
but for our modern rapid printing all the lines
must be open and all black. He may, however, use
a rough or grained paper, and this will break up
the lines and give a grey effect to them. But he
will find, save in the better magazines, and even there
the printing has degenerated, he will often get blacks
when he wants greys and greys where there should
be blacks, owing to poor ink and careless, unionized
printing.

But the most certain method is to use smooth
white paper and strong black ink. There are also
tinted ruled papers which may be scratched into
half-tones and then lights. The drawing should
be not only carefully thought out, but carefully
worked out.

Phil May made elaborate pencil drawings before
he inked them in, and then often laid a piece of thin
transfer paper on the pen drawing and redrew it,
leaving out unnecessary lines and strengthening
others, and continuing this till he got by repeated
work the fresh, spontaneous quality he wanted.

Forain’s drawings are not knocked off. He is a
big enough artist to know that freshness and spontaneity
are the results of long and hard work. Here
such elementary facts are not known, and geniuses
who come today and go before tomorrow knock
off masterpieces which are the delight of the cultured.
// 143.png
.pn 126

So far as I have seen him work, Beardsley never
made a pencil drawing, but put a few lines on his
paper and started in with a pen. Abbey and
Charles Keene greyed and diluted their lines, but
to get the proper effect on the pages all their grey
lines have to be gone over with a graver, or roulette,
by the engraver, for if they are not, they will
print perfectly black. I began by making elaborate
pencil drawings and inking lines over and around
them. This was the method of Rico and Vierge,
the right method. Colored inks, too, should be
avoided, as the camera is no respecter of color, and
beautiful blue inks may disappear completely, and
rich reds turn pot black.

The same is true of lead pencil, which from its
shine and greyness is bad for reproduction. Charcoal,
crayon, and lithographic chalk are much better
for line drawings, as they are dead black and any
shine or glitter in the drawing may photograph badly.

There is, however, a method of reproducing
drawings which are grey, or shiny, or smeared, and
incompetents take refuge in these defects, but if a
line drawing has any of these defects or qualities,
it must be reproduced by “half-tone” and not
direct-line process. By this method almost anything
can be reproduced and very wonderfully
reproduced, too, but this method cannot be satisfactorily
used for cheap and rapid printing, and also
it is twice as expensive as the direct-line process.
It might be well again to explain both; the illustrator
must understand them and their requirements.
The line drawing is photographed on to a sensitized
copper or zinc plate, where it appears in black,
usually reduced in size. This ability to reduce or
enlarge the drawing and also to reverse it for printing
// 144.png



// 145.png



// 146.png
.pn 129
is one of the aids, the most important one we have,
from photography. The photographic print on the
metal plate is then washed, the photographic film
disappears, save the lines of the drawing, or all
the blank spaces are got rid of in some of the
endless patented fashions. The plate (usually a
number of them) is put in an acid bath, and the
exposed part of the plate is bitten away. It is then
taken out, looked over, heated, when the ink runs
down the sides of the lines and protects them, and
the biting is continued until the design stands up
from the acid-lowered plate. Large spaces are dug
out by gouges and machines called “routers.” When
bitten the plate is mounted on a wood block the
height of the type and is ready to print from. This
is the theory of mechanical line engraving.

In engraving wash drawings or paintings, the
wood engraver cuts parallel lines or series of dots
through the washes or tones, thus breaking them
up into a printing surface, as the screen does mechanically.
In printing, blacks can be reduced and
greys strengthened either by cutting the face of
the block down or by pulling proofs, cutting them
up, and putting the cut-out blacks over or under
the block on the press. This gives increased pressure
in the press and increases the color where it
is wanted. This is known as underlaying or overlaying.
But today it is almost useless for the artist
to look to the printer to help him—he must make
his drawing as nearly the way he wants it to print
as he can, and take no chances.

By the second method, which is used for all
other drawings, in fact for reproducing everything
not in line or not pure black, the drawing is
photographed through very finely ruled screens,
// 147.png
.pn 130
containing some hundreds of lines to the square inch.
This is done to break up tones or to prevent greys
from printing black. An oil painting could not be
reproduced by the line process, but can by this.
The lines in the ruled screens tell as whites on the
darks of the design and as blacks on the light portions.
They can easily be seen by magnifying any
reproduction of a painting or photograph printed in
a book or paper. When the design is photographed
on to the metal plate, it is bitten or etched more or
less in the same way as a line block. This work
can now be done in as few hours as the old men
spent weeks in engraving on wood. Whites may be
etched out by this method as in the line process, or
dug out by engravers.

The screen has been a great blessing and a great
curse to illustration. By its use paintings can
be reproduced and any sort of drawing; consequently
a tribe of money grubbers have arisen who
can’t draw, can’t paint, but they have formed a
combine, and the screen and the artless editor are
altogether responsible for the utter downfall of
American illustration. For a while editors believed
they could drive artists out of the magazines by
photography. People got sick of it. But they
have standardized and sterilized artists in a fashion
to delight a prohibitionist. Some day—and there
are signs—illustration may revive, but today it is
rotten in America, like the country and the artless
people. This sort of popular person has debauched
the country. He knows nothing of art, or engraving,
or printing. Cash is his only aim, ideal, ambition.
I believe he gains it.

Drawings, however, may be intelligently prepared
for the half-tone process in wash or oil, but
// 148.png
.pn 131
by either one the screen deadens, lowers, flattens
them, even with the greatest care in photography
and etching—and the printing press usually ruins
what is left. The drawings should be made in
black and white monochrome—in water color
charcoal grey is excellent—in oil each artist has
his own scheme. Some use gouache and tinted
paper, or body color. There is no rule and no certain
result, save that color is bad. They are
reproduced without any etching out or engraving
out of whites, or hammering up blacks. The art
editor thinks a black should be like shoe polish and
a white like a shirt front used to be. The only
way to get the proper effect is to leave the flat
screen dots all over the block; this simply lowers the
tone, which the art editor doesn’t like, so he digs
a hole in the block to get an effect and prints it in
yellow or green, and the photo-engraver scratches a
corner and planes off the side, and the printer
souses it in ink, and these and many other things
account for the artlessness of the American art paper.

No amount of reproduction, no method will make
bad paintings into good illustrations, and it is
with bad art most of bad journalism reeks. The
editors and the public neither know nor care how
the unsalable painting flaunts as an illustration,
the delight of the vulgar herd. It is ridiculous
to say color can be reproduced by the present
mechanical methods. How can a painting, which
has no pure red or blue or yellow in it, be copied
by the use of raw reds, blues, and yellows? The
engraver and printer must use the colors the artist
used, and the artist must know what colors to use,
what colors will reproduce and print. Both must
study this in a technical school. As a proof of the
// 149.png
.pn 132
success of the three-color method, let the photo-engraver
try to reproduce a piece of undrawn-on
grey paper by this process.

Color can be reproduced and printed only as the
Japanese have used it in their color prints—by
drawing the design in flat tones as a mosaic, as all
good color printers have done, printing the colors
one after another, side by side—that is the only
way, the way good work alone can be done. Three-color
processes, in which red, yellow, and blue
blocks are used to get effects by superposition and
secondary or other color combinations, are very
wonderful, but they are not art; but in a nation of
canned musicians and margarine-eaters cold-stored,
three-colored art is bound to be popular—with all
but artists, and what do they amount to?

To make color prints, as many blocks must be cut
as there are colors. The artist must mix the colors
himself and put them on one by one, colors that
will print. This method can be employed for
rapid printing. It is the only right one. The
three-color scheme can be seen on the cover of any
magazine, each more artless than the other. The
artist must be prepared to have meaningless, artless
tints of blue, brown, or green stuck over his drawings
by artless editors and printers, the drawings cut
in half and put on two pages facing each other,
bits cut clean off—in fact there is no end to the
barbarities, vulgarities, and inanities the art editor
will perpetrate on an artist’s design after it has
left his hands.

With proper technical schools, national schools,
we would get skilled workmen, men and women too,
who understand the printing art. We would then
again take the place we have lost as the leading
// 150.png
.pn 133
nation in the world of graphic arts, a proud place
we once held. It is the duty of this Institute to
give you students a chance, and it would pay
artistically and financially.

THE GRAPHIC ARTS ETCHING|THE ETCHERS THIRD LECTURE TUESDAY
.ce
APRIL 13 1920

.dc 0.4 0.4
LAST week I tried to talk to you about Illustration,
and this week I want to take up the
subject of Etching. Both are forms of Graphic
Art, and after Illustration, Etching is the next older
form. I told you last week that Illustration dates
back to the very earliest ages. Etching, however,
as we know it, is a much later product, and begins
with the Middle Ages.

The earliest forms of etchings were prints made
from designs by goldsmiths, silversmiths, and other
metal workers, as a record for themselves, or in
order to show to their clients patterns and designs.
These designs were mostly for sword hilts and other
decorative work in metal and were made by drawing
the lines on the surface of a metal plate through an
acid-resisting varnish, or cutting them directly into
the metal with a graver, of which I showed you the
// 153.png
.pn 136
form in the first lecture, rubbing into the sunken
lines black paint, placing on the surface of the
metal decorated a piece of paper, and rubbing it
on the back, in the same way that the Japanese today
make their wood cuts, by rubbing. The ink
came out of the lines upon the paper which was
rubbed. The lines were filled with black enamel
later. This form of work was known as Niello.
Casts are also said to have been made and printed
from. There was no intention on the part of
these craftsmen to make prints, but they did make
prints despite themselves, and it occurred to artists
that this method might be used for engraving or
etching flat surfaces of metal by multiplying these
rubbings. It would be easy to trace this, if I had
the time, but it has been done in a previous
course by Mr. Carrington, <i>Etching and Engraving</i>,
who discussed the old work. But if I want
to talk about modern work, there is so much to
talk about that I can refer to only the most
notable work that was done in the past and to
only the most notable work in the present. Yet
among the artists of the past were men whose
work we have never surpassed. The greatest were
Dürer and Rembrandt. Whistler, however, has surpassed
Rembrandt as an etcher. Dürer lives as an
engraver.

Dürer’s engravings in metal have never been
approached in modern times, by modern artists.
He made but few etchings, and those etchings were
done, not on copper, but on iron. Why, I do not
know, or what sort of acid he used to bite them.
The only thing of any importance is that he used
the same tools to make these etchings as he did
for his metal engravings—the same tools we use.
// 154.png
.pn 137
That is, all of this work was evidently, from the
form and the shape of the line, drawn with a graver—drawn
very lightly. First he covered the whole
face of his plate with an acid-resisting varnish and
drew through that varnish with a graver, and not
with an etching point, as in this “Great Cannon.” I
am certain he made the lines with a graver lightly
on the metal. Anyone who has had any experience
can tell that they look like engraver’s lines
and not like etcher’s lines.

THE METHOD IS UNCERTAIN

But instead of doing as the etcher does in order
to get strength and depth and perspective, biting
these lines for various lengths of time, the faintest
lines bitten only a few minutes, the stronger ones
several minutes more, and the deep dark ones for
many minutes longer, it is perfectly evident that all
the biting was done at once, because they are of
different width, but the same depth—different-sized
tools were used. The blacks are made by putting
the lines closer together and not by deeper biting.
If you will compare a metal-engraved portrait by
Dürer—and there are many of them in the print
collection—with an etched portrait by Rembrandt,
you will see what I mean. It is almost impossible
to tell you or explain the difference any more than
I have done. Though in the engraving the line is
firm and sharp, in the etching it is ragged and
varies in firmness. You have to feel these things.
But the great thing about this “Cannon” by
Dürer (Page 139) is the amazing way in which he
has got the light and shade and expressed the different
qualities of surface and the different objects in
the composition in simple, pure, open line.

Look at the ground around the “Cannon.”
Those of you who remember the design I showed
// 155.png
.pn 138
you by the British artist, Sir John Millais, must
see that he got his idea for that little illustration
to <i>The Parables</i> from studying the stony foreground
of Dürer’s “Cannon” done three hundred years
before. And what could be finer than the drawing
of the “Cannon,” unless the drawing of the landscape—the
whole is a masterpiece. It was done on
iron. Steel was not used until the beginning of the
last century.

I am not going to say anything more about
metal engraving, only call attention to the work
by Mantegna and also by Nanteuil.

Later the art fell into the hands of commercial
engravers, who were not artists at all. They
were patient plodders. They killed the art. And
nothing has been done in steel engraving, except
for commercial work, for twenty or thirty years.
The last man who practiced it in this country was
Alden Weir. He did one plate which was really a
delightful and charming example of metal engraving.
Metal engraving is virtually dead now, just
as wood engraving as an art for reproducing is
dead. Government and bank note work is engraved
on steel, and, if the designs were only as artistic
as they are elaborate, would be amazing; but our
government has no use for artists.

It was not until after Dürer that the art of
etching really came to perfection, and although
etching has been practiced ever since, there are
only two supreme etchers who have lived in this
world. One of them was Rembrandt and the other
was James McNeill Whistler, and the latter was the
greater etcher.

This print by Rembrandt was not only, at the
time it was made, a very extraordinary etching, but
// 156.png



// 157.png



// 158.png
.pn 141
it still is, and is an example of another form of art.
Rembrandt was the first man who found that work
was picturesque, and that his father’s mill and the
people who lived in the house by the mill were
worth etching. Before that artists had never
condescended to tell any stories about the life
around them for their own sake; but Rembrandt
was one of the first who did not regret that the
houses and dykes of Holland were not in Greece,
and that the Jews of the Amsterdam ghetto were not
Romans of Trastevere and wore togas. He found
that beauty was all about him. He was the first
artist to see the picturesqueness of Holland.

Rembrandt made a number—some twenty or
thirty—of landscape etchings. Most of them are
greatly praised for I don’t know what, except perhaps
for their being as bad as anything that was
ever done in landscape. On the other hand, he
made a few of the most perfect etchings of landscape
that have ever been made.

.pm il 157 300 Page_140
.ca PAGE 141 REMBRANDT: THE GOLD WEIGHER’S FIELD

No artist since—although this was done in fifteen
hundred something or other—has ever surpassed
that tiny plate of the “Gold Weigher’s Field”
(Page 140). It is only a few inches long, and yet
in that space you have the whole of the flat Dutch
country, the lay of the land, the dykes and ditches,
the great stretch of country to the little village,
the shady woods and away off the line of the sea;
done with the fewest of lines, and every one of those
lines means something and could not be left out. If
any of those lines were left out the plate would not
be complete. That is the proof of a great etching.
Just like the drawing of the “Mad Dog” by Caldecott,
where you cannot leave out a line without ruining it,
so with this etching, a single line left out would spoil
// 159.png
.pn 142
the design, and a single line added would be one too
many. This use of expressive, vital, necessary line is
the characteristic of great etching and great etchers.

Rembrandt made other and quite different
landscape etchings. This is one I think I can call
the most notorious, “The Three Trees.” The trees
are rottenly done, and so is the foreground. The
bit of middle distance is exquisite. The composition
is wonderfully arranged; and as for the sky,
that is one of the most amusing things. Some
authorities on the art of etching say that rain
is coming on, and others that it is going off. You
can take your choice. I say that the clouds are
very beautifully drawn, but what they are doing
I don’t know; I don’t know what the storm is
doing, whether it is coming or going.

There is a very curious thing about this plate,
and that is those perpendicularly ruled lines for
rain. Now in all Japanese prints the same lines are
used for rain, and I wonder more and more whether
Rembrandt gave the idea to the Japanese—whether
some of those Dutch merchants who made their
way out to the East carried this print and were the
means of giving this idea to the Japanese—or
whether Rembrandt got his idea from the Japanese,
from the prints which the merchants may have
brought back. There they are, in both Eastern
and Western art. I do not think any of the learned
experts have ever referred to this before. They
usually do not refer to the things that are characteristic
and worth referring to.

One of the other amazing plates that Rembrandt
did was the “Six Bridge.” This, we are told, is
one of the best of his etchings; it is one of the worst.
I would defy you to tell me on which side of that
// 160.png
.pn 143
canal those trees are growing, or what kind of trees
they are, or what is the matter with that boat.
The bridge is not so badly done, and there is a
little bit of beautiful work in the distance; but just
because an old master did some great plates is no
reason why we should fall down and worship all,
as all the authorities do except myself—I suppose
I am not an authority. I am often told I am not
by those who are not. But I refuse to accept this
as good work.

There is a story about this plate. The story
is intended to show the time it takes to do an
etching of this sort, or a better one. I do not
believe that Rembrandt took any longer over that
wonderful “Gold Weigher’s Field” than he did to
make this mess—if he did make it. He was said to
have been dining with his friend, the Burgomaster
Six, and the bottle of schnapps or beer or mustard
or something had been forgotten, and it was sent for.
While the servant was on the way for it Rembrandt
pulled a grounded plate out of his pocket and produced
this masterpiece on it. It would have been
a great deal better if the story had been carried on a
little further, saying that he bit it, anyway that
they were dining in the gutter, as the perspective
shows, and that he carried a printing press around
with him and printed it while they waited. It is out
of such nonsense that art history is manufactured.

On the other hand, the “Beggars at the Door
of a House” is one of those figure studies by Rembrandt
as marvelous in design as the “Gold Weigher’s
Field.” In this he has rendered the beggars at the
door in both a dramatic and a realistic fashion. It
is one of the masterpieces of Dutch art, and one of
the greatest etchings of the sort that has ever been
// 161.png
.pn 144
done; yet it is scarce ranked above the drivel of
his imitating successors by the authorities.

The two great etchers were Whistler and Rembrandt,
and this I am going to prove to you by
putting these two plates on the same slide. If
there is one vital thing about etching, it is that
the artist must not try to imitate somebody else,
but be himself, and do his work in his own way, or
he is not an etcher—and most artists are not, though
the world is filled with etchers today. Still I do
not think that since Rembrandt there have been a
half-dozen great ones added to the list. Whistler
was one, and a greater than Rembrandt in his use of
vital meaning line.

You can see these two plates were done from
virtually the same spot—at least the artists were
seated on the same spot, Rembrandt looking toward
Amsterdam, Whistler sitting with his back to
Rembrandt etching the country toward Zaandam
three hundred years later. What I want to point
out to you is the totally different way that the two
men treat landscape. Rembrandt works right up
to the foreground, and also elaborates the town in
the distance in great detail. Whistler always
believed that the spectator’s attention should be
concentrated on the important spot and the rest
of the subject ignored. The windmills in his
subject are the important things and those are all
he has drawn, only suggesting that boat tied up to
the edge of the canal. But what those plates do
show, as well as the next one, is the different way
in which different artists work. Unless there is this
individuality in treatment there is no art. Whistler’s
handling is far more direct and simple than Rembrandt’s;
he gets more with fewer lines.

PAGE 147 REMBRANDT: THE MOTHER
WHISTLER: ANNIE HADEN 

ETCHING PLATES PLACED TOGETHER TO SHOW DIFFERENCE
OF HANDLING EMPLOYED BY THE TWO ARTISTS[**Need a table for this?]
.ca-

Here is another comparative slide (Page 145).
This is Rembrandt’s amazing portrait of his mother,
one of the finest things that was ever done in etching.
Alongside of it is Whistler’s study of his niece, little
Annie Haden. What I want to point out is that
one man did his work in his way, and so did the
other. There is no attempt to imitate. Both are
trying to do the people they saw, one his mother,
and one his niece, and each made an immortal
portrait in his own way. Both of these men were
great draftsmen, great craftsmen, and that is the
first necessity before you can become a great etcher.
How many of you students try to do this? You try
to copy your instructor—or someone who is the
fashion of the moment—not to study good work—and
be yourselves. If you don’t do this you will not
do anything. Most of you won’t.

Rembrandt cared more for color, Whistler more
for line, but etching is a line process and Whistler is
the greater master of line.

ETCHING

The “Christ Presented to the People” (Page 146)
is a glorious plate. I know of nothing more magnificent
in manufactured etching than this plate.
Almost every one of those figures is an outline,
and yet every one of those lines is full of expression.
Still it is not spontaneous etching. The composition
is perfectly arranged, and so is the drawing and
the biting; and to bite a large plate of that sort,
as Rembrandt has done, is an amazingly difficult
thing. He carried this plate on through several
states. He did not bother his head, or trouble himself
at all, nor did any of his contemporaries, about
local color and costume. Instead of the building
being in Jerusalem, it is a building probably in
Amsterdam; and the people, many of them Jews,
// 165.png
.pn 148
are dressed in the clothes they wore in the ghetto
of Amsterdam. Few artists at that time, when
they went in for historical composition,[** corrected obvious typo in scan: was compositon] cared anything
about local color or historical accuracy.
What they cared about was to do their work as
well as they could, building it up from the material
they had; and Rembrandt did this supremely well.
Still the highest form of etching is sketching—and
not making potboilers.

Here is another, “The Three Crosses.” In this
plate there is more attempt at costume. This is
one of Rembrandt’s most magnificent plates which
are compositions, religious prints made for dealers—made
to sell. Whistler said that “the big plate is
an offense.” He never intended, I know, to refer
in that statement to Rembrandt, because he admired
Rembrandt enormously; he only referred to the
large machines with which, if you walk down Michigan
Avenue, you can see that all the large shops are
decorated, plain or in colors. And that kind of work is
rotten work; therefore it is popular, and the kind of
thing some of you would like to do—because it pays.

But the sort of thing that Rembrandt did, like
“The Three Crosses,” “The Raising of Lazarus”
(if he did it), and a number of other plates, were
religious prints which were published and sold just
as sporting prints are sold today; only then religion
rather than golf was believed in and practiced.
There is no one among us today who amounts to
anything who is doing anything in the way of religious
art; but, as I say, religion was then a popular
subject, and these prints were religious propaganda
and were perfect examples of what could be done by
etching. Yet they are not spontaneous, but built
up with the greatest thought, care, and elaboration.

ETCHING

I want you to understand that “The Gold
Weigher’s Field” and “The Mother” are vital spontaneous
expressions and “The Three Crosses”
an elaborate composition, carried out by Rembrandt
perfectly, but to a degree that is not the real aim
of etching. Its aim is doing as Van Dyck did in this
portrait (Page 151) quite personally. Here you see
every line and dot has been done by the etcher with
a meaning. There is not a superfluous stroke about
it, that is, as far as Van Dyck carried it. After
the plate was taken up by professional etchers and
engravers who put in costume and background and
carried the composition down to the title at the
bottom, they finished it, and finished it in every way
as an etching.

Another man who also practiced etching very
extensively a little later was Callot, and in his
“Horrors of War” he too was a preacher and
propagandist; he made a series of remarkable
plates. They are upstairs in the print room, and you
should look at them and study them. His work is
much more direct and simple than Rembrandt’s.
Callot was a most prolific person. He published
many plates besides these “Horrors of War,”
and they have come down to us as a notable
example of contemporary facts. What have we of
the horrors of the World War in etching? The
printing of Callot’s plates is poor because he seems
to have published them very cheaply. Probably
he did not do the printing himself. Then there
was Hollar too who preserved much the Puritans
destroyed in architecture and costume. Who is
really doing anything to preserve our customs
destroyed by hypocrites, prohibitionists, and business
men?
// 167.png
.pn 150

Another man who lived a little later in England
is Hogarth. This plate is finished with the graver.
Hogarth began his plates, which he carried on during
all his life, nearly always as etchings. But they
were all finished by himself and his pupils with the
graver. He probably etched the subjects first, as
Van Dyck did, his pupils and assistants finishing the
published plates.

FROM AN OLD PRINT

I want to show you just for a minute—though we
are going to have a press here, on Thursday, I hope, and
try to do some work—how the men in the past made
etchings. These plates (Pages #135:headp3#, 151, and 152)
were taken from Abraham Bosse’s Book on Etching.
You see the etcher biting his plate which has been
grounded, and drawn upon; and acid pouring over
it runs down it and into the trough below—just as
the photo-engraver works today. The other man is
drawing under a screen. The screen is used in order
to diffuse the light and let him see the lines in the
copper plate. This youngster is heating something,
probably making etching ground. There is a man
biting a plate, at the back of the print, just as we
do today. These plates from Bosse show us more of
technical methods than any number of descriptions.
In the old days, instead of using a bath as we do
now, a border of wax was put around the edges of
the plate after the drawing was made on it, and
this wax border retained the acid which was poured
on the plate. It was a delightful method, I know,
because I have tried it once or twice myself,
and the beauty of it is that the acid leaked out
under the wax, and it got on your clothes, and
burned your fingers; nevertheless here in these
prints is the proof of the way the old men bit their
plates.
// 168.png

// 170.png
.pn 153

This man is smoking the plate. The plate has
been grounded, the varnish put on it. I will show
you how it is done on Thursday. I don’t know
how they did it; probably they dabbed the varnish
on. The plate is hung up, or it was in those days—we
don’t do it now—and a lighted taper was placed
underneath it, and the lighted taper smoked the
plate and turned it a beautiful black, and that was
done in order that they might see the lines in the
glittering copper through the black surface.

Here is a man heating the plate exactly as it is
done today. What makes these old prints so very
interesting is that you learn how the work was done,
although many of the methods have been abandoned.

Here is a printer at work, at the press. This
shows the sort of printing press which was used
three or four hundred years ago. It was all made
of wood. Now they are all made of metal, as you
will see on Thursday. The plate is put on the bed of
the press; you can see the edge of it. The dampened
paper is laid on it. Then this plank of wood covered
with blankets is pulled through, under great pressure
between the rollers, the man with all his might
pulling that plank through from one side of the press
to the other, and when that is done the ink has come
out of the lines on to the paper. This he lifts up, and
the print is on it. Up at the top the prints are
being dried. Apparently the old printers did not
use blankets. They used an upper plank instead.
These are prints hung up to dry—that is no longer
done. This is a very interesting plate, because it
shows the form of press on which Dürer and Rembrandt
probably printed their proofs.

This form of press was used in Venice, and almost
a similar one was used by Dürer when he made his
// 171.png
.pn 154
visit there, and certainly by numbers of the old
Italian engravers, and certainly also by Whistler
and Duveneck. I worked on it myself. The
performance of that press was magnificent. The bed
used to move about halfway, and then it dropped
about a half an inch, and if you didn’t get out of
the way quickly enough you got the bed on your toes.

Another etcher of the eighteenth century was
Piranese. Although most of his prints were finished
with the graver, still in a series of etchings of
“The Prisons of Rome” he made a set of designs,
very unrealistic, but very dramatic, and justly
regarded as of great importance today.

Chodowiecki, a Pole, was another workman who
illustrated a vast number of French books during the
eighteenth century, with a great deal of grace and
the greatest perfection of craftsmanship.

.ca PAGE 154 F. GOYA: THE WITCHES. FROM “THE CAPRICES.”\
AQUATINT AND LINES

And then came Thomas Rowlandson (Page 155).
He etched his designs. You can see the lines through
the tint upon them. Those lines were first etched,
and then on the top of them a ground called aquatint
was placed, which gives a tone to the whole plate,
and adds richness in printing. Aquatint was put on
because the etcher wanted a tone on his plate and
could not trust the printer to get it. Goya also made
many aquatints (Page 156). His design is better
than his technique. In the early part of the last
century many very fine designs were made in aquatint.
The art is to a certain extent lost today, but
it is being revived.

I showed you some of Blake’s wood blocks last
week. Here is one of his etchings from the <i>Book of
Job</i>, one of the most impressive things ever done in
art. And this design is pure etching. I am told it
is engraved. But on the outside of the design he
// 172.png





// 173.png



// 174.png
.pn 157
drew a border, in some sort of acid-resisting varnish,
and then when he got his design drawn through the
varnish, and this part drawn with liquid acid-resisting
varnish, he put the whole plate in the acid
bath and bit the two parts together, one in intaglio,
the other in relief, and both printed on the same
press—at the same time. It was a very interesting
and very successful method, and certain artists have
resurrected it.

No one, I think, has used lines in a more effective
way than Blake. After this was done nearly all
of these designs were colored by hand. When they
were being made Blake could scarcely sell them, but
now they are the treasures and the prizes of all
collectors who can obtain them. Cotman did much
in etching of various sorts. Here is one in soft
ground. I will show you how it is done later. It is
a charming method of work, and one which was
practiced with the greatest success by the early
English engravers.

David Lucas and other Englishmen reproduced
many artists’ work in mezzotint. The whole of the
plate is covered with a roughened surface, which
is obtained by taking a tool, the face of which is
covered with a multitude of small teeth, and rocking
it violently forward and backward in twenty or
thirty directions, and this roughened plate of copper
or steel is rocked until it will hold the ink, as a solid
black mass, which is dabbed or rolled on it.

When the rocking has been done, the engraver
or artist—very few artists have tried it because
although it looks very easy it is a very tedious
process—with a scraper and a burnisher draws the
whole design by scraping and burnishing in the
roughened surface; the design is made entirely by
// 175.png
.pn 158
scraping down the ridges and humps and roughnesses
that cover the face of the plate; and finally when it
is scraped down the design is done, thus leaving
more or less of the roughened surface which holds
the ink placed on it. This is mezzotint.

FOR MEZZOTINT TO SHOW THE WORK

Turner for his <i>Liber Studiorum</i> (Page 155) did the
etching for many of the plates himself; a few of them
he also scraped. Here is an etching by him which
shows the first stage (Page 159). Look how every
line means something. It shows that he was a
great etcher, because he drew lines which have
meaning. The etching was a guide for the mezzotinter.
Through the roughened surface he could see
Turner’s lines, and with the etched lines as a guide
he scraped the subject out.

.pm il 176b 300 Page_159b
.ca PAGE 158 J. M. W. TURNER: ST. CATHERINE’S HILL. MEZZOTINT

This is the finished plate. You can see in various
places in the tree trunks, and in the distance, where
the etched line has been used, and you can see in
the extreme dark where the roughened ground has
been left untouched. That is what the French call
the <i>manière noire</i>, the black method, the manner
of drawing with the scraper from dark to light.

One man who has to come in as an etcher,
although we may not think it, is John Ruskin.
Think what you will of Ruskin as a writer, and I
must say that I think of him with very mingled
feelings, except as a master of beautiful English—there
is no question that John Ruskin was an
artist, a man who, if he had not written, would live
by his art. This is being recognized. In this
plate is great feeling for form expressed by simple
line in the drawing of that sheer cliff. It is a
masterpiece. And the British are for the first time
honoring Ruskin, because this winter there was,
in the Royal Academy, a show of his work which
// 176.png



// 177.png





// 178.png
.pn 161
produced a profound sensation on people who did
not know he could draw. He was a very master of
drawing. There is one thing these plates prove,
and that is that one must be a master of drawing, and
draw better than anyone else if one wants to be an
etcher. Don’t worry about drawing—if you cannot
draw you cannot etch, and if you cannot draw you
cannot do anything; yet an etcher must know how
to bite and print his plates.

.ca PAGE 161  C. MERYON: THE COLLEGE HENRI QUATRE.  ETCHING

Another man who was a great etcher, and is now
a great success, was Meryon (Page 160). He did
many plates of old Paris in remarkable fashion.
But he was in modern times, as Rembrandt had
been before him, a commercial proposition, not for
himself, though Rembrandt was, but for people who
exploited his works.

This plate, “The Stryge,” is very popular; it is
almost sacred. It has been a great commercial
success, and so has a great financial value. It has no
value excepting that; it gives no idea of old Paris—there
isn’t any idea in it at all. But it is regarded
as something holy, yet there is no merit about it,
nothing really of any value, except the drawing of
that crouching figure. In “The Stryge,” the height
above the city is not given, the houses are not well
drawn, the church tower is pathetic. There is everything
which is bad about it; and to crown all Meryon
imitated Rembrandt’s trick of putting an oval on a
square-edged plate. Meryon had little idea of art
and less of decoration. He said he was no etcher,
and he told the truth about himself in this plate.

But every once in a while Meryon did a marvelous
plate. “The Morgue” is one of the greatest of his
designs. This is quite another story. Though much
of its fame depends on the story at the bottom.
// 179.png
.pn 162

“The College Henri Quatre” (Page 160), however,
is certainly the most wonderful study of a great city
etched by an artist. The way in which he has got
the feeling of Paris, receding into the distance,
street beyond street, and house beyond house, is
something that no one before had ever done, not
even Dürer, and no one since has ever attempted
or probably ever will succeed in doing. Yet it is
no portrait of Paris—but it is Paris—all through it
there is that curious thing about him, that spirit of
madness. And in some of the early states the town
is about half drawn, and in the distance are cliffs
and mountains and farther away is the sea, and
any number of strange creatures are in it, proving
that he, when he was doing his most wonderful
work, was insane. Yet there is nothing in the whole
of etching to touch the distance he put in the city.
And although Hamerton said that this was all done
from nature, the mere fact that he had in one state
a background of sea proves how little Hamerton
knew what he was talking about on that occasion.
Meryon’s “San Francisco” is another of his incredible
views of cities, and no one knows whether he
ever saw San Francisco.

This is a form of etching that was greatly practiced
in England—an illustration from Pickwick.
It doesn’t matter who made it. It might have been
made by Cruikshank, or by any one of a number of
others; it was done by Seymour. But that is the
kind of thing that your grandfathers were brought
up on, the few of them that came from England, and
that is the sort of thing that was taken seriously.
That England ever survived it is something I cannot
understand, but everybody took that sort of stuff
seriously, instead of Hogarth. How the country
// 180.png

// 182.png
.pn 165
came to degenerate to this extent I do not know.
That thing is pretty nearly as bad as the comics
we love—no, not so bad by any means.

.ca PAGE 165  F. SEYMOUR HADEN: SUNSET IN IRELAND.  DRY POINT

But England got over this attack and produced a
fine etcher in Seymour Haden (Page 160), and here
is one of his dry points which I think is one of the
most beautiful renderings of landscape that was ever
made. Dry point, I might explain to you, is not
bitten line. The design is drawn entirely with a
very heavy and very sharp steel point; there is no
biting; it is pure drawing, with the point. In order
to get fine lines, those delicate ones in the sky, and
those in the foreground, the point is held almost
vertical. And if you want to get that richness you
see in the foreground you have to go over the lines
several times with great force, digging into the
copper. But by holding the point at an oblique
angle you make a furrow as a plow does, throwing
up the copper on one side; the more obliquely you
hold the point the more you throw up the metal—and
it takes a certain amount of muscle to do
that—the more the metal is thrown up the more ink
sticks to it, and that is what gives the richness. In
steel and copper engravings either that ridge of
metal is cut off, or the graver itself cuts it off; but
in dry point it is left and called burr, and everything
is done to increase its richness and depth. I
know of no landscape which is more beautiful or
richer, and which gives a greater effect of a deep,
dense wood than “The Sunset in Ireland” by
Haden.

Here is one of his etched studies (Page 163).
This was done from nature. All that I am going
to show you were. It is a study of one of the
Welsh castles, in which every line means something,
// 183.png
.pn 166
as Rembrandt’s lines mostly did. This is one of
Haden’s smallest and one of his best plates. Haden
was a worshiper of Rembrandt, but in his best
plates he was himself.

.pm il 180b 300 Page_163b
.ca PAGE 166  F. SEYMOUR HADEN: HANDS ETCHING.  ETCHING

Here is another, “The Breaking Up of the
Agamemnon,” a composition which he made, he
said himself, when on his way to a dinner at Greenwich.
He was all dressed up in his evening clothes
and going down to dinner on a steamboat, when
he happened to see this great composition, and he
got off the boat, pulled the copper plate out of his
coat-tail pocket, did the etching, and lost his dinner.
I happened to be lunching in his house when he told
this story, and another Scammon lecturer, Mr.
Hopkinson Smith, was also there, and when Haden
told the story Smith said to him, “If you can carry
a copper plate large enough to do that on in the
pocket of your evening clothes, what sized copper
plates do you carry along in your ordinary clothes’
pockets?”

I don’t believe Haden’s story. I don’t believe
the plate was done from nature—that upsets my
theory—not at all; it looks as though it was—Rembrandt’s
does not. Haden’s line means something—Rembrandt’s
does not. This plate shows how
Haden held his point. He worked with this huge
instrument which I wouldn’t want to have anything
to do with; and those are the gravers and dry
points which he used. But the etching is really
a fine thing as well as a valuable record of the
way he worked. It is the title-page of a collection
of proofs of his etchings published in Paris about
1860.

Now I want to talk to you about the plate.
It is fine because each line means something. Look
// 184.png
.pn 167
at the stunning way in which he has drawn the
movement of the Thames water. And those of
you who know the Thames know how well it has been
done, how perfectly it has been expressed. There
is no tone on the drawing of that old hulk against
the light; it is all in outline, just as Whistler did in
those Blue and White Porcelain Pots that I showed
you the other day. And look at the color of the
setting sun. You feel the color of the sunset, you
feel the whole thing, yet it is all in line; but each line
means something and is drawn with meaning and
bitten with skill. If you do not feel it, you will never
be able to understand etching. Most of you won’t.

.pm il 181a 300 Page_164a
.ca PAGE 167  F. DUVENECK: THE RIALTO.  ETCHING

Another man who followed Haden and preceded
Whistler in Venice was Duveneck (Page 164), and
he made in the seventies a series of plates of Venice,
and also some in Florence. At the time these etchings
were stupidly or maliciously supposed by people
who ought to know better—and one was Seymour
Haden—to have been done by Whistler, who had
been sent to Venice to etch the city.

This was an entirely new view of Venice, and all
of the plates made by Duveneck in Venice were
new in viewpoint and handling, and you should
study them all. Some of them are upstairs, and a
complete collection is in the Cincinnati Museum.
He is one of the least known of our artists in America
today, but he will live in the future when some of
our high-priced geniuses are forgotten.

And now I come to the biggest man of all. And
whether you like it or not it is a fact. And that man
was James A. McNeill Whistler. He was trained, and
trained thoroughly and carefully and accurately,
and he was trained in the best schools that we have
in the United States of America as art schools;
// 185.png
.pn 168
one was West Point, the other the Coast Survey.
He learned to draw at West Point, to etch in the
Coast Survey. And while he was at Washington
he drew the coast line and profile of a map, but
wanted to see what would happen if he drew and
bit certain faces and figures on the copper. He
found out, and he also found out that he was not
to waste government copper, and in order to make
sure that he wouldn’t waste any of it in the future
they sacked him. But he remembered what he had
learned, and he went over to Paris, and produced in
a short time, with the knowledge he had gained,
a number of fine plates in Alsace and Paris, when
he was about twenty years of age. These are “The
French Set.”

If you remember, and keep it in your head,
Rembrandt’s “Mill,” here you will see is a somewhat
similar subject, and yet there is far more go,
far more life, and far more color in that than Rembrandt
ever got. In this he went far beyond the
Dutchman, and so he did in a number of the other
early etchings of “The French Set.”

This is a curious one, “Street in Saverne,” because
it shows that from his earliest years Whistler loved
the beauty of the night, and began by trying to
etch it. And yet that is done in a very simple
fashion. Some of the lines are meaningless, some
are scribbled and some of them are very mechanical,
but he got what he wanted, and he rapidly learned
how to etch with the fewest, the most expressive lines.

This study of a wine glass is done frankly and
purely in rivalry of Rembrandt’s “Shell.” Both
are examples of splendid technique.

One of the most exquisite of his early prints is
only the study of a small boy, the son of his landlord
// 186.png
.pn 169
in Paris. It shows perfectly what I have been
trying to tell you; every one of those exquisitely
drawn lines means something. There is a body
inside of that little blouse, and how wonderfully
the hair is drawn, the turned-up nose, the little
hand, and the bit of sofa on which the boy is sitting,
and the whole thing is done with the fewest of lines,
and lines which express everything—if you cannot
see this it is useless to look at etchings.

ETCHED AND DRY POINT LINE

Here is another study of his niece (Page 172),
whom I showed you in that slide in comparison
with Rembrandt, known as “Annie Haden in the
Big Hat.” I think it is about a foot high, and it
enlarges to the size of one of his full-length portraits,
and is just as stunning as they are. He
really felt, and all these men whose work I have
shown cared as much about their etchings as they
cared for their illustrations, or for their paintings,
or any other form of art. It is in dry point, the
greater part of it. See the wonderful way in which
he has rendered that 1860 costume, and that hat
which is supposed to be so ugly is really a triumph
of art.

.ca PAGE 169  J. A. McN. WHISTLER: BLACK LION WHARF.  ETCHING

After leaving Paris and coming over to England
in the late 50’s and early 60’s he did a series of plates
of the lower Thames, and this “Black Lion Wharf” is
one of them (Page 164). If you will look carefully
you will see that the etching of each of those houses
shows the material of which it is built, and the
different times at which the different houses were
built. The wood and the brick and the stone and
the whitewash are all there. There is color, yet
all is in line. And the barges are perfectly done.
Look at the drawing of the details, and the various
mooring arrangements on the side of this barge,
// 187.png
.pn 170
done with the greatest simplicity, and yet every
single line tells, as every single line does in that
longshoreman who is sitting in the barge.

That is one of the great triumphs of Whistler’s
early life. He said he did not like it, but I do not
agree with him.

He told me that it was all done out of doors, and
the drawing of the background took him three
weeks. He never did anything except from nature.
He never was able to work except when he was
working from nature, or a model.

Jo was his model for the various “White Girls,”
the little and the large ones. And she had evidently
been posing for him, and this day she was tired out.
For though he was the most kindly and gracious of
men, and most considerate to women, save when
they were posing, he thought then of nothing but
his work. And Jo, evidently tired out after an
hour or so of standing, threw herself in a chair, and
there she rested. But he never stopped; he found
a plate and made his dry point of her. Every
change was a new subject for him, and this print
of Jo, “Weary,” is the most exquisite portrait that
was ever done in dry point in this world (Page 171).
Everybody is beginning now to believe me about
this, and it is the truth. You can find nothing to
touch this plate for sheer beauty by any artist
in any age.

Whistler went, after various experiences, to Venice,
and if you can remember that plate by Duveneck
you can see how differently the two men treated
the same subject. Yet at the time they both
lived very close together in the same city and
in the same part of it—and they both etched
the Riva, but how differently! If I could have the
// 188.png



// 189.png



// 190.png
.pn 173
two artists’ plates and put them together, you
would see how utterly different the two men’s technique
was even when treating the same subjects.
Look at the work he has put in this Riva, the figures,
the architecture, the gondolas. It takes a mighty
lot of drawing to do a thing like that, but there is a
mighty lot more left out[**.] No one in modern times
could do it as well. Probably that is one reason
why some of you don’t want to draw—it is rather
difficult to draw—yet without drawing you can do
nothing—not even paint.

Here is another exquisite Venetian study made on
one of the tiny canals. And there is one thing about
it that those of you who have studied and know
something about composition—which is another
valuable thing you will have to learn some day—will
see in this plate, and that is just exactly what
John Ruskin preached all through his <i>Elements
of Drawing</i>, another valuable book that you ought
to read, for it will give you some new ideas, and
that is, the way in which the lines of the design of
“The Bridge” lead right straight up to what Whistler
considered the most important thing in the composition,
the distant group of trees, and one line leads
right up one side, the other up the other side, in the
same way. Did you ever think how valuable lines
are to convey meaning and arrangement? That is
marvelous composition, because it is not obvious,
it doesn’t hit you in the face, but there it is. It is
all thought out, and every one of those lines in that
plate is thought out and thought about before
it is even put on the plate. That is what Whistler
meant by saying an artist’s work is “finished
from the beginning,” not what fools thought he
meant.
// 191.png
.pn 174

And there was another curious thing about his
work, the drawing of it. He always said that he
began with the most important part. Probably
he began in this plate with the bridge, and drew it
in completely, and then filled in the rest of the design
as he wanted it, but he got the bridge right, for in
etching you cannot add to your plates as you can
to paper or canvas; you must place things right.
He always called it the Japanese method of drawing.
I don’t know where he got the idea, or
whether the Japanese had any such idea, but he
always said he believed it was the way they worked.
If you asked a Jap he would tell you it was so—but
whether Hiroshige worked that way he would
not know.

Whistler said he couldn’t draw architecture.
I don’t know who could have drawn this Venetian
house better.

.ca PAGE 174 J. A. McN. WHISTLER: THE DOORWAY, VENICE.  ETCHING,\
SHOWING PRINTING IN TONE

This old doorway has been rendered by him in a
fashion which no one has ever approached, though
many have since tried. Look at the difference between
the old water-worn stone work at the bottom,
and the rusty iron work above, and the way the
whole design has been made into a decoration, with
his monogram of “The Butterfly” crowning all,
harmonizing with the rest of the work. The
richness and depth of shadow within that doorway
is almost unbelievable. And in several of the prints
the water is altogether painted, so strengthening
and giving accent and support to the architecture.

Many people will tell you that the etcher should
never use printing ink as paint as it has been used to
get richness of effect, as in “The Doorway” (Page
175). The etcher should do whatever he wants, if
he can do it, both in biting and printing and it is a
// 192.png



// 193.png



// 194.png
.pn 177
mighty difficult thing to do what he wants. Whistler
did paint with ink on this plate, and brought forth
the result he wanted. It is true that later he did
not paint with ink. This design is painted on the
plate. That is, reinforced by ink, and that is what
gives the richness. When these plates were made
no one wanted them; now they are among the
most beautiful proofs, it is said, that have been made
of Venetian subjects. They are not one bit better
than when they were made.

In his later work he depended less on printing.
This is one of the plates of the “Old Guild Houses in
Brussels.” It is said in one of the Lives of Whistler
that it is really an expression of “the bones of
architecture.” There is not a single, superfluous
line in it, not a single line could be left out. Yet it is
altogether different from anything he did before,
and altogether different from anything he did
after. He never repeated himself; he carried on.

Here is one of the latest London plates drawn
with this same simplicity of line, and yet the handling
is different. Further progress he was always
making.

And so again in this plate made in Amsterdam.
You have a certain amount of that same richness
of printing of the Venice series, but I know you have
never seen more wonderful drawing. The texture
of everything in this plate has been rendered in the
most truthful fashion by the most skilful craftsman
of all time. This is one of his great plates, a plate
that Rembrandt never came near. Of course you
can say that Whistler made no great religious
subjects, and Rembrandt never did any subjects of
this kind. But all Whistler’s work is etching—some
of Rembrandt’s is manufacturing.

Here he stands beside his printing-press (Page 176).
He always wanted someone by him when he worked
and was most kind in allowing one to see how he
worked, and in helping one and teaching one everything
he knew. There were no secrets with Whistler.
As he once said when somebody told him, “There
is no secret in that,” “Yes,” he said, “the secret
is in doing it.” And that is where the secret comes
in, in all art. And as he said too of printing, if you
don’t know how you made a good proof and can’t
do it again what was the use of doing it at all?

Another etcher was Felix Bracquemond. He
was a contemporary of Whistler, and did some great
plates. His studies of birds are fine, like this
“Raven.” But his greatest work was done in portraiture,
in copying other men’s work, though his
own portrait (Page 214) and that of the De Goncourts
rival Dürer in their way.

Another extremely interesting artist was Félicien
Rops, who used aquatint and dry point in an
extraordinary manner. He is a very great technician.
You want to look up his works, of which
there are reproductions in Ryerson Library.

Mary Cassatt (Page 179) is another notable figure,
and this is a dry point of a “Mother and Child”
which belongs to the Museum. Many of her plates
were intended to be printed in color. The color was
slight, just washed on, more like a Japanese print.
She worked the color in by hand, or had some
very clever printer assist her in doing it. Some
of her prints are most charming, not only in line,
but in color. Most color in etching is abominable.
“Black ink on white paper was good enough for
Rembrandt; it ought to be good enough for you,”
Whistler said.

Félix Buhot (Page 180) worked in every conceivable
sort of way. There are all sorts of technical
methods employed in this extraordinary plate only
two or three inches long, but size has nothing to do
with a masterpiece. Buhot was a man who found
beauty in commonplace things. I think he was the
first man to see that the hansom cab was worth
drawing, and a rainy day in London an inspiration,
and he drew it and etched it, I am sure, out of
doors. You couldn’t get that freshness without
doing it out of doors, and all great etchings have
been done from nature.

There are a series of Embarkations or Landings
at Dover and Folkestone, nearly always under rain.
The studies of the Houses of Parliament, and the
French cafés—all these are very notable and worth
looking up. You ought to look up all Buhot’s work,
because if you don’t you won’t know what not to do,
or what has been done, and you may think yourselves
original when you are not.

.ca PAGE 181 A. ZORN: PORTRAIT OF RENAN. ETCHING

Zorn (Page 180) is a very big artist, but a very
bad etcher. That, of course, is rank treason. The
drawing of Renan’s face is perfectly stunning, the
etching of his coat perfectly vile, but Zorn is a painter,
not an etcher. He seems not content to render
Renan’s face as Rembrandt did his mother, and
Whistler his niece, but he has to show that Renan
wore a black coat, and he does so with a characterless
line, a painter’s line, not an etcher’s line. What
difference does it make what kind of coat he wore, or
what color it was, whether black or white? If Zorn
was a big enough etcher he would have shown in
three lines that it was black. But he has to prove it
black by drawing a multitude of lines. There is no
real feeling for line in that coat at all. The face is
// 199.png
.pn 182
full of it. And this is the case in almost all of Zorn’s
work. Those coats and things, instead of being
drawn as Whistler would have done them, or Rembrandt
would have done them, with the fewest and
most expressive lines, are fumbled and elaborated,
and scribbled on. The only person who can appreciate
useless line is the collector, and he pays an
awful lot of money for his appreciation.

Here is “The Toast.” Look at that oily, smiling
face of that professor wonderfully done. But look
at the awful coat again. There is absolutely no
drawing in line in it at all. That old crumpled-up
hand is most amazing, and so is the glass in it.
But he could have put, as Rembrandt did, the
whole feeling in it, without putting a single one of
those meaningless lines in. And that is where Zorn
is altogether wrong, and if any of you follow Zorn in
this way you will go wrong, and ten times more
wrong, because there is nobody in this room who can
follow him.

Cassatt, and equally interesting. Each keeps its

Bone is one of the best-known Englishmen, and

his war work done in England made him deservedly
a great reputation. And I have placed these two
prints together. Here is a slide which shows you
exactly what I have been talking to you about, and
that is that the etcher should make every one of
his lines mean something. Every one of those lines
in Bone’s plate in that cliff (Page 184) and the landing
has a meaning. In this big plate (Page 184) I
cannot find a single line that means anything, any
more than Zorn’s lines. Both Zorn and Brangwyn
are painters, neither is an etcher. Brangwyn ought
to paint and let etching alone. He tries to do everything,
and sometimes comes down. He does come
down very much in his big etchings. The smaller
Brangwyn’s work, the better it is. His subjects are
well chosen and impressively carried out.

Here is a little one which is very good indeed, the
study of the building of the ship. In his subjects of
work, of labor, Brangwyn has made deservedly a
great success, but he has no feeling, mostly, for
line, like Zorn. But he has a great feeling for
composition; in most of his paintings and drawings
but only in a few of his etchings, he has done
very good work indeed. Brangwyn is like Zorn—a
painter’s etcher, and not an etcher’s etcher.

I want to show you a modern printer’s shop (Page
286)[**], and that will end this talk. That is the place
that I have to work in, and I love it. It is one of the
most amazing shops in America, in my own town,
in Philadelphia. There is the sort of press that I

to give I can show you what making etchings
means. It means working like a slave. But it is a
delightful slavery, and it is work that I love, and
I love to do the whole thing, from one end to the
other. If you do not care for that, if you take
up etching and do not find the biting as fascinating
as the drawing, and the printing as enthralling as
the biting, you are not an etcher and you never
will be.

.dc 0.4 0.4
LAST Tuesday I showed you a number of prints
which are universally admitted to be the
greatest that have ever been made, because in
studying any art what you want to study is good
// 205.png
.pn 188
work only. And that is what I have been showing
you. But in etching there is another and an equally
important part, and that is the making of the plate.
Unless the artist does the whole of this, unless he
not only makes the design on the plate, but etches
it—that is, bites it into the metal, and then
prints it—he is not an etcher, he is only a duffer, a
shirker, because if he does not do all the work it
usually is because he cannot do it, and so he hires
someone else to do it for him. We know that from
the time of Rembrandt artists have always done
all the work of etching, although I don’t believe
that Rembrandt ever tried, as I am going to do,
to make a plate before an audience. Well, I am
going to try to do it, and I have two intelligent
people to help me. And even the three of us may
fail to produce it; at any rate we are going to
have a go at it. And I am also afraid that you
will not be able to see a good many of the different
operations.

The first thing which it is necessary to have in
order to make an etching is either a zinc or a copper
plate. Copper has usually been used, from the
beginning. Certain other metals have been tried.
As I told you the other day, Dürer made etchings
upon iron, but from Rembrandt’s time copper has
been almost universally used.

We have been trying, within the last few years,
to get some substitute for copper, and zinc has been
greatly employed for two reasons: One, because it
is very much lighter than copper, and, if you are
going to make plates out of doors, you will find that
copper plates are very cumbersome things to carry
about, and that zinc is very much lighter; and
the other reason is that it is cheaper.
// 206.png
.pn 189

But zinc is not so sensitive, not so sympathetic
as copper, and being softer it will not yield so
many impressions. The chief reason it is used
is because of its lightness, and another reason is
that when the plate is prepared for etching, and the
ground is put on as I shall do in a minute or two,
you see your lines light, white in the black ground,
and when the copper is grounded you see them a
golden hue in the black surface. But seeing your
lines in glittering light on the black instead of in
black on a white ground, you quickly get used to.

Another metal that has been tried is aluminium,
and if we could only find something which would
bite it with certainty it would be used altogether,
but no method of biting aluminium, with any degree
of certainty, has been found. A plate of aluminium
is almost as light as a sheet of paper.

But zinc is good to practice on, excepting for
dry point, which I will tell you about in a minute,
because zinc is very soft and brittle, and any lines
drawn on it with sharp points, and then run through
the press, are liable to break or wear, so that most
etchers use copper. The zinc is employed more
for large and bold designs, like these by Brangwyn.
These are drawn with very strong lines, and the
plates are very thick and heavy, almost as heavy as
copper. But he uses zinc, as I think most etchers
do, because it is cheaper, and for bold, big work
it is reliable. Only bigness and boldness are not
desirable.

The first thing in etching is to heat the plate;
take a wooden-handled vise, and to protect the
corner of the copper plate from being scratched
by the bite of the vise you put a piece of paper
between the jaws, screw up the vise, and put the
// 207.png
.pn 190
plate on the heater. It will take a minute or two
to heat up.

On the plate, as soon as it gets hot, you rub this
ball of ground, which is made, I believe, of tallow
and varnish and black—I do not really know what it
is made of, for the makers will not tell me. And
they won’t tell you, either. This ground which I
use is made by Weber of Philadelphia and is better
than you can make. The etching ground is an
acid-resisting varnish, which must have three or
four necessary qualities; the most important is that
it should resist the acid. The varnish also must
be put on so thinly that you can draw through it
in any direction with a needle point, a small instrument
made of steel. This is the sort that is mostly
used. It is a double-ended point, and the drawing
is made with either one or the other end through
the coating of varnish, which I will now try to put
on. I rub the varnish on the edges of the heated
plate as you see.

The plate has to be fairly well heated before
the varnish will melt. Electric heaters are not
very good. The proper one is made like this, but
has gas jets under it, and they give a much stronger
and more uniform heat, and you can regulate such a
heater better than you can this electric burner.

The varnish is put on around the edges in a
layer, and as soon as the plate gets hot it melts very
easily, forming a layer of varnish after one gets it all
around. I never tried one of these electric things
before, and I am certain I never will again. The
etcher, to judge if the plate is hot enough, either
touches it with the varnish to see if it will melt, or
he spits on it, and if the saliva jumps about, it is
right.
// 208.png
.pn 191

Then you take a roller of this sort, a rubber
roller fitted into a wooden handle, and by rolling
the ground off of the edges and all over the
plate you will in a very few minutes get the
entire plate coated with it in a very thin layer,
and that surface of varnish is what you draw
through, and it protects the parts of the plates
which are not drawn on. The roller worked in
this fashion makes the ground stick very firmly
to the zinc or copper plate. The more you roll it
the thinner and the more smooth the surface
becomes. It requires only a very thin surface to
protect it, but you must cover it all over, for wherever
there is a hole in the varnish the acid will
bite in and make a hole in the plate, usually
where you do not want it.

As soon as the ground is on, you take half a
dozen wax tapers, light them, and holding the
plate varnished side down, so that the flame from
the tapers does not touch it, you pass the tapers
back and forth under the plate in every direction,
and if you do not burn your fingers, as you will
frequently, you get a perfectly black surface all over
it in a minute or two. This is quite black enough
now. It is not absolutely black. You want it only
so dark that you can see the lines when you come
to draw on it. If you burn it you have to wash it
off with turpentine and ground the plate again.

This is the method of commencing to make a
bitten plate. But there are a number of other
methods which can be employed. One which is
much used is dry point. That is, instead of grounding
the plate as I have done some artists smoke it
as I did. Then you take another point, a stronger
and a heavier one, a point which is very hard and
// 209.png
.pn 192
heavy, and make your drawing, as these drawings
have been made, digging into the ungrounded copper
or zinc plate. Copper is better for making dry
points, because the zinc is so soft and so brittle that
when you come to run it through the press the
ridges of metal I told you about the other day,
which are thrown up on one side of the line as you
draw on the plate, will break off. If you want a
fine or grey line you hold the point vertically, but if
you want a very deep or black line you put your
point down at an angle to the plate, and use more
muscle. And when you get it down in that direction,
more metal is thrown up at the side of the
line. This ridge of metal is called burr, and it is
this ridge of metal which holds the ink on the plate
in printing and gives color to dry point.

.pm il 210 221 Page_193
.ca PAGE 192  M. LALANNE:  SOFT GROUND ETCHINGS]

There are many other methods of work. You
may make what is known as a soft ground etching.
You take this ground, and melt it and mix it with
about the same quantity of tallow. It will never
become hard, and you put that in the same way on the
face of the plate with the roller and smoke it, and
when the plate becomes cool you put a sheet of rather
rough drawing paper on the face of it, and draw
upon the paper, which should be put firmly down
upon the plate; you can fasten it down by wetting
it, and pasting it on the back of the plate as one
stretches paper for watercolor, and then draw with
a pencil or with hard charcoal or chalk on the paper.
The point penetrates the soft ground underneath it,
and when you take the paper off you lift off the
ground too and you will find your drawing in line
on the metal plate shining and glittering, and then
it is bitten just as we will bite this one in a
minute.

Aquatint is another method. And I discovered
in this institution only the other day, in the hands of
Mr. Philbrick, a new method of making an aquatint.
The old fashion was like this: Take the clean copper
plate and either pour resin dissolved in alcohol over
it, and then slightly heat it, when the resin forms
itself into little granulated dots, and the spaces between
those can be bitten, or else put the plate in
an airtight box, which has a door in the front, and
then put in that box a quantity of powdered resin.
In the box also is a fan which is made to revolve,
and the dust which rises is allowed to settle on
the plate, which is, when heated, put in through the
door, and when it cools the resin settles in granulated
points, on the face of the plate.

After that ground had been laid in that way—or
by Mr. Philbrick’s method which is simpler, for
he takes an eye-dropper and places some powdered
resin on the edge of one plate and blows it with
the dropper on to the other, and then heats it;
when the plate is cool the ground sticks to it; this
is the simplest method that I have ever seen, and I
hope it will be known in the future as the Philbrick
method—then the artist paints the subject upon
the plate. That is, he commences, and instead of
painting his darks, he paints out on this grounded
copper plate the high-lights and bites it a minute or
two to get a tone over it, and bring out the lights,
and then paints the design around the lights, putting
the plate into a bath of acid and allowing
it to bite. The painting is done with acid-resisting
varnish called liquid ground. The first tones are
bitten for two or three minutes, and then when you
want a greater dark you paint out more of the design,
then put it in the bath again, biting a few minutes
// 215.png
.pn 198
more, and then paint darker parts out with varnish,
going on in this way until you get to your extreme
dark. It is a very difficult process for most of us
moderns.

But there must have been a method which has
been completely lost, for at the beginning of the
last century there were a large number of very wonderful
aquatints made and published very cheaply,
and very widely, in England and in France, and
there must be some practical method of doing
the work which we now find so very difficult, for the
artists of that day did not seem to have had any
trouble at all. It may be that this new method
is the right one; I am going to try it. The other
day I saw the results which were very interesting.

Another method which somewhat resembles aquatint
is sandpaper ground, and that is very much
more simple, and easier to manage, and you get
stronger and richer effects. You take a grounded
copper plate and lay it on the bed of the press, then
lay over it a sheet of sand or emery paper, and
run sandpaper and plate three or four times through
the press. It is grounded in the ordinary way,
just as I grounded that plate; and after you run
it three or four times through the press, the sandpaper
that is placed on top of it breaks the ground
into little granulations, and then you paint with
liquid ground your design on the surface, biting
your darks more and more strongly into the plate.
It is rather difficult to manage, because you must
know exactly what you are about, and one of the
things in all etching is that you have to be sure of
what you are trying to do; you cannot experiment
much with the plate; you hit or miss. Some people
have endless patience, but I never heard of an
// 216.png
.pn 199
etcher who had any. You either get things or you
don’t, and you usually don’t. I speak from a lifetime
of experience of failures.

Whistler dreaded this work, because when he had
made his beautiful drawing on the plate there was a
chance of spoiling it in the biting or in the printing,
but the artist who does not carry out every part of
the work is not an etcher, and he never will be.

I should have grounded this plate about twenty-four
hours ago and let it stand until now to let
the varnish cool and harden. I don’t know at all
what will happen working on it so soon. You take
the point and draw with it as you would draw on any
other surface. There are only three or four things
to remember, and those you must remember. The
drawing you make on the plate is not the print you
are going to get off the printing-press. The drawing
is not the end of etching, it is the beginning,
and in order to get lines to print properly, you have
to think of the way in which you put them down.
The first thing you have to remember is that as these
lines are bitten into the plate they enlarge; therefore,
if you wish to make a plate which has a very
delicate distance, you can draw those lines which
produce the distance very closely together, but if
you leave them exposed to the acid for more than
two or three minutes they will probably, even with
the best of grounds, all bite together into a dirty
black mess, or rather, a grey mess, for the ink on
the surface, as I will show you in a few minutes, is
of no account; it is the ink which goes into the
lines themselves that prints. And the lines have a
curious way of acting.

As the acid bites into the copper (nitric acid, I
use), eating down, it bites into [**symbol]'s [** this A is wrong I’m sure] of this sort,
// 217.png
.pn 200
and if you have enough of them, too close together,
you will find that your surface instead of showing
delicate lines, will be a dirty mass, the acid having
bitten the lines all together. Therefore the deeper
you want your lines bitten, the farther you must
place them apart.

That is the most important thing to remember,
about drawing on copper or any other metal plates,
that the print is made from the ink which is contained
in the lines, the bitten lines, not the ink
which is on the surface, as in wood engravings; it
is the ink in the hollows of the lines which the press
forces out.

I cannot really pretend to make a drawing in
the time I have, but this young lady can make one
while I am going on with preparing plates. It is
so difficult that I don’t want to make a mess out
of it.

After the drawing has been made, and it should
all be made with the same point, it is immersed in
a bath of nitric or some other acid, and the finest
lines are allowed to bite only for a minute or two,
then varnish is painted on these light lines, the
middle distance is bitten twice as long, and then
that is painted out with the stopping-out varnish, and
the foreground, or the part of the design which is to
be the strongest is left in the bath the longest.

There are other ways of biting plates. One,
which is a very interesting method, is to commence
by drawing the darks first, and biting them—the
darks of the design. You allow them to bite until
you think they are bitten enough, then draw the
lighter lines over them. The whole is a matter of
guess-work backed by experience, for the biting of
a copper plate not only varies with each day, but
// 218.png
.pn 201
sometimes with each hour in a day. Not only that,
but you may get differences in the composition of
the copper and the zinc. In fact, no etcher is ever
sure of any plate that he is doing, and the longer he
works, the less sure he becomes.

After you have drawn the black lines in this
negative method, you draw over them the middle
distance, and put the plate in the bath again, and
then finally draw in the lightest of all. All bite
together, but the darks will have bitten three times
as long and the middle tone twice as long as the
lights. This gives relief and perspective; before
the plate is bitten it looks perfectly flat.

This is a very simple method of biting, theoretically,
but as a matter of fact you have to work out a
scheme on every single bit of your design, because
you cannot change it at all. It is difficult to make
corrections in the plates, unless you do not mind
drudgery. You can rub out with charcoal and
scrape out and burnish out lines, but it is a long and
tedious process, and there is only one artist who has
done much in this way, and that is Rembrandt, but
Rembrandt had a school, and I am sure he employed
the pupils to do that work for him. Moderns do
not have assistants usually; you see I am lucky
enough this afternoon to have two.

Now I take the acid and pour it on the drawing.
There is one thing about etching—it is not a clean
process. And if you mind burning your clothes and
staining your fingers you will never become etchers.
This is not pure acid, but is mixed with an equal
proportion of water, and it should be mixed the
day before you use it. And if the plate is put in the
bath and a little of it poured on it, it ought to bite.
I say it should; I do not know whether it will or not,
// 219.png
.pn 202
because frequently it does not do anything, at least
in the beginning. The varnish protects the undrawn-on
parts of the design, only those parts which have
been drawn on, exposed metal under the lines, will
be acted on by the acid. One has to coax it about
to make it bite. It is biting on the back beautifully.
And now it is biting in the design. I know this
because there are bubbles rising; they show the acid
is at work on the metal.

This ground is so well made that you can draw
in any direction through it, and yet it does not
crack or break up. That is one of the most important
things in a ground.

After you have bitten the plate it is necessary
to dry it to see what you have done, as nearly as
possible. Then if you hold it up on the level with
your eye you can see the lines, in shadow in the
black surface of the plate. You can imagine that
the ordinary etching is not made in quite this
free and easy sort of fashion. Although, as I
told you, Rembrandt made that plate, the “Six
Bridge,” while the waiter was hunting up the
mustard-pot in some remote part of the house.

I am very much afraid that this plate will be
pretty much on the same character as that—not a
great work of art—I do not mean the drawing,
because the drawing is beautiful. You saw the
assistant do it. It is now bitten enough and I did
not stop out the light lines; I tilted the acid about.

The ground can be dissolved immediately by
washing it off with turpentine. You see, theoretically,
what a remarkably simple process this
part of it is. But in the first place this ground
should have been allowed to dry for at least a day,
and then an hour should have been taken, at least,
// 220.png
.pn 203
for the drawing, and, as Rembrandt said about
etching, you should take one hour to make the
drawing, and spend one week with the stopping-out
varnish, stopping out the lines that you do not
want to bite. But he, instead of putting the plates
into a rubber bath like this, on which the acid has
no effect, made a border of wax all around them,
and then poured the acid on the drawing on the plate;
the border of wax kept it from running off.

The modern way is to cover the back of the plate
with varnish of some sort to protect it from the
acid—any kind of cheap varnish that nitric acid
will not act on will do—and then to immerse the
whole in the bath, biting and stopping out as I
have told and shown you.

But it is very much more interesting and amusing
to take a few drops of acid, as I did, pour it on the
plate, and then with a feather drag the acid about.
It gives a variety to the lines which you can get in
no other way. The feather is also used to brush
away the bubbles which form on the lines and stop
the biting.

In order to print the plate, which will be the
next operation, you again put it on the heater, and
then go to work with the ink roller. This is one
form of ink roller, but there is another and a much
better one; the roller is in the middle, and there
is a handle at each side of it. That is the newest
form of etching ink roller.

With a roller of that sort you can leave a great
mass of solid black down here in the corner, or you
can leave the lightest tints. It is an American
invention, and an excellent one. This one that I
am using is an older form. This arrangement on
the top is placed there so as to keep your hands
// 221.png
.pn 204
out of the ink. I never used a roller of this sort, and
I think I am using it rather cleverly. In beginning
printing it is well to rub the ink into the lines with
your fingers.

When the plate is inked in this way you slide
it on to this wooden box, which stands alongside,
and when the plate gets too cool you slide it back
again on to the heater, then taking a piece of rag,
folding it up, and putting it into the palm of your
hand—you will be able to do this after several
years of experience—you proceed to wipe the ink
off the surface of the plate and not out of the lines,
and I can tell you that it is a craft that requires
rather a little bit of experience. But the man, as
I said, who makes an etching must care just as
much about the biting and the printing as any
other part of it. There is an equal amount of art in
every one of the three stages of making a plate:
in the drawing, in the biting, and finally in the
printing.

And you may do anything in printing. Some
artists maintain that an etching should be printed
simply and cleanly, or almost cleanly, leaving only
a slight film of ink on the surface. Others maintain
that you should paint on the surface, in fact, you
can paint on the plate with ink, and then by dragging
it around, leaving some here and some there, you
can get the most varied effects.

I do not think this plate is quite as much a work
of art as I thought it was. Still it is a practical
demonstration of the way I work.

Now, you can see from this—or I hope you can—that
the ink has been wiped off the surface of the
plate more or less, but not out of the lines, and you
must keep the ink in the lines, and doing that
// 222.png
.pn 205
and yet getting it off the face of the copper is not
an altogether easy affair.

BY MR. LEE STURGIS OF CHICAGO

When you have done this, the next thing is to
prove the plate, which you do by putting it on the bed
of the press. And I might as well say that this press
(Page 213) has been built here by Mr. Sturgis, in Chicago,
and is the most perfect printing-press I have
ever seen. It is based on an English copper plate
press that was manufactured in England by Haddon
& Son from Sir Frank Short’s design; but like
most English things that are very well made, it was
very cumbersome; the space which the English press
takes up is twice as much as this. And there was
no reason for that at all. Mr. Sturgis has designed
a machine which, I believe, is going to revolutionize
printing-presses in Europe, and in this country too.
It seems to me it is the most excellently designed
and the most excellently made press that I have
come upon. There are many details about it,
such as the extra press underneath for pressing
prints and drying paper. That also acts as a
sort of weight in the center, keeping the balance of
the press perfectly.

The whole theory of the press, as you will see in
a minute, is this. At the bottom is a big solid
roller, on the top is a flat plank, or bed of the
press, as it is called, and above is another smaller
cylinder. When the plate is placed on the bed of the
press and a sheet of dampened paper laid on it—you
have to dampen the paper in order to get the
ink to come out of the lines, to print properly—then
on top of the paper three or four pieces of
blotting paper are placed and the blankets on top of
them, and you turn the wheel, and the plate passes
between the cylinders, the blankets take the direct
// 223.png
.pn 206
pressure off, and also go into the bitten lines in the
copper, and draw the ink out as the plate passes
through. And here is the work of art.

In the first place there is not half enough ink in
the lines—we can get a great deal more—then we
can get them a great deal stronger. But this is
the whole theory, and the practice too, of making
etchings. It is a serious affair, and one not to be
lightly trifled with. But it is interesting to be able
to show you the way in which etching is done.

There are many other forms of etching; one very
interesting method is to take a plain copper plate
and then cover the face of it with a coating of ink, as
I did before with the roller, then handing it to the
eminent artist who will now proceed, by means of
rags and paint brushes and anything which comes
handy, especially his fingers, to make a design on
it, painting from dark to light. When that design
is made—and he can do it in a very few minutes;
you can see how quickly he does it—it is passed
through the press, and the design should come off
on the paper. That is called a monotype. But that
is the way in which complicated printing is done,
by leaving more or less ink on the plate.

You remember those two Venetian studies by
Whistler that I showed you, though they were not
done so freely as Mr. Philbrick is doing it—still
that is the method in which the printing by Whistler
was done, by painting the design on the lines which
had been etched, as this one was, on the plate.
I can easily get an entirely different effect out of any
of these plates in the same way, by leaving more or
less ink on them.

Many people have carried monotyping to such
an extent that they make monotypes in color, but
// 224.png
.pn 207
it grew out of this method of leaving a tone over the
face of the plate and then wiping the design out of
that. Sometimes very beautiful results have been
obtained. (I ought to have someone to do the talking
while I am doing this work.)

Even the folding of the ink rag is a thing that has
to be mastered, because you have to get the rag folded
up into a rather loose, soft pad, and in order to wipe a
plate you must carry this pad in the palm of your
hand. If you use your fingers you pull all the ink
out of the lines, and the ability of the great printer
is to coax and to wipe and to paint and drag ink
on the plate with this very sensitive mass of inky
rag. It requires, in order to do good work, a
very great deal of practice, and there have been very
few who have mastered it. Everyone admits at
the present time that the greatest modern master
of printing was Whistler; even professional printers
have been compelled to admit that. A few years
ago they said he was all wrong.

It has been said by many authorities that Rembrandt
never did anything of this sort; that he wiped
his plates clean. But we have no proof of that,
and it may be that these prints, which were made
three hundred years ago, had a tone of ink on them,
and the ink which was left on the surface dried to
dust, for at times when you take a print out to
look at it, that tone has become dust and blows
away. I have heard of this happening after a
print had been put away for twenty-five years,
and taken out of a drawer or portfolio where it had
been kept.

There are many other things that a printer does
in order to get tone after he has wiped the plate
nearly dry on the surface. By one motion of his
// 225.png
.pn 208
hand he wipes the ink off the surface, and by another
almost similar, but a reverse motion, he wipes it
back again, but all that takes enormous practice.
If you do not care for the mysteries of printing, again
I can only say you will never be an etcher.

There are other ways of making these fascinating
plates. One modern form of reproduction which
I should like to refer to is rotogravure—which you
see in the Sunday supplements. This is the application
to rapid printing of etching. Drawings or
prints are photographed and transferred to copper
cylinders. These are etched as other copper plates,
then placed on the press designed for them, ink is
spread on the surface and in the lines, and then as
the cylinder revolves a sharp razor blade scrapes the
ink off the face of the cylinder, the ink in the lines
coming out on sheets of paper as the cylinder
revolves farther. This is the method by which
the rotogravure sections of papers and magazines
are made. It is a modern German method only
half understood here—though used in most of the
weekly papers.

Another scheme is that of printing plates in color.
This is very popular at the present moment. Vast
numbers of these color etchings are made today.
Most of them the artist had no part in. They are
a combination of misdirected energy and photography.
You can see several of them on Michigan
Boulevard this afternoon in the shop windows. I
was told by one artist that he had nothing to do
with them except to sign his name and draw his
check. He was very successful with that latter
proposition. But if you want to become an etcher
there is something more to be done than signing your
name and drawing a check.
// 226.png
.pn 209

Now these color operations I do not believe in,
even though the artists did them all themselves,
because a person who really does not care for the
beauty of good black ink on good white paper is
not an etcher.

There are other ways of making tones which are
much used by printers.

They have a fashion, when the plate is wiped,
of going over it with a trembling motion of their hand
holding a rag, and producing a tint in that way—dragging
the ink out of the lines slightly. This is
called <i>retroussage</i>.

But after all, the etching is not dependent, or
should not be dependent, on printing. If you cannot
get the lines right, get good lines; if the drawing is
not right and the biting is not right, no amount of
printing will make a good thing out of it.

You see how beautifully this press runs. With
the old-fashioned press you were forced to climb
up and down on it. It was a very interesting
performance. It was far better exercise than golf,
and more amusing, and with more beneficial results.
But all the same, I must say that it was not a press
which ran as smoothly and as beautifully as this
does.

On this print you can see that there is not half
enough ink, but you can see that I again have left the
tone all over it, and brought the strength of the design
out. Or you can leave it clean and white. There
is no end to the methods you can employ.

The great thing is that the etcher should not
depend on printing, but he should depend on the
excellence of his drawing and the accuracy of his
biting, and if he has done that the printing will
probably more or less take care of itself. Unless
// 227.png
.pn 210
you do care for all these different processes which
go to make up an etching, I do not think you will
ever become very great etchers, and the man who
does not enjoy printing, and who does not enjoy
biting, has the chance of enjoying only half of the
work.

The hour is almost up. If you want we can print
some more of these plates. There are a number
here that the students have done with a great deal
of care, and it might be well to try one or two of
them.

The method I have shown you is a method that
all artists employ both for biting and printing. It
is really a very simple process, and in fact nearly
all arts or crafts are simple. The only thing is to
take advantage of these simple methods and to
try to do your work just as well as you can. And
I can tell you, in order to do it well, it will take a
whole lifetime of practice.

If you want to wait I can show you some more.
But the time is up, and I will try only one or two,
and if any of you care to stay to see how the printing
is done and what these plates look like we will
go on with them. Some of them may produce much
better results than we have had so far, because these
were really done with some care, and we must try
to print everything with the greatest care.

That is really all there is to the technique of
etching and of copper-plate printing. But you want
to exercise the greatest of care and not do it in this
haphazard sort of fashion, though an etched plate
apparently will stand a great deal of strenuous
treatment.

This is a far better plate, and one that has been
done with a great deal of thought for line. As I did
// 228.png
.pn 211
not make this—I never saw the plate before—I
would not be surprised if I could not get anything
out of it. It is not inked enough; there is not
enough ink in the lines, but still it comes off pretty
well, and is a rather charming design. It was done
here in the school.

There is another thing about printing: The ink
does not really get into the lines until after three
or four proofs have been pulled, and the first proofs
that one gets are rarely the best. Then after three
or four have been printed you get some of the
best of all, and then you have, in most cases, the
horrible disappointment of seeing the design go,
and it finally fades away until there is nothing
left of it.

Some plates will give only a few proofs, and
others will give quite a number. Any number of
prints can be made by steel-facing the plate—putting
a coat of steel on it, really electroplating it.

In the old days one used a machine like this.
You took this pad and pounded it in the ink violently,
and then you pounded the surface of the
plate with it. The ink went into the lines all
right, but the lines went out of the copper, and the
consequence was that it was possible, except in the
rarest of cases, to get only a few proofs of dry points
which were worth anything.

But with this new roller you can get a large
number of proofs equally good. The collector is
very much disappointed with that, because from
the collector’s point of view rarity is the great merit
of all etching. If there is only one proof, and the
artist did not like that, that is the one that the collector
tries to get hold of. For instance, there is a
celebrated one—I think it is of a rabbit or a pig—*
// 229.png
.pn 212
*that Rembrandt sketched on a corner of a plate,
which he did not like, and there are only two or
three proofs of it known to exist, but the whole
world of collectors is running around hunting for
those proofs. The fact that later he drew all over
the plate, and satisfied himself when he bit it, proves
it from the collector’s point of view to be utterly
worthless. Artists differ from collectors in those
things, and they both have their point of view.
But what I cannot understand is this: Why a
collector who wants something which is rare, does
not buy original drawings, which are unique. But
that is the sort of thing that collectors do not
want; instead, they buy rare proofs, and they will
not buy originals. Often the last state of a plate
is far better than the first, though the artist may
spoil it by overworking—but usually the first state,
though incomplete or unsatisfactory to the artist,
is the one the collector collects for its rarity.

I can tell you about a very celebrated plate
that Whistler did. He told me that he was sitting
on a wharf, when some gentlemen, who were of the
laboring profession, and who were building a wall
behind him, dropped a brick. It did not hit him,
but he jumped some feet away, to avoid being hit,
and as he jumped, he scratched the copper plate
he was drawing on from top to bottom. I can
assure you that print with the scratch on it is one
of the Whistler prizes most cherished by collectors.
The print that has not a scratch on it is of very
little account to anyone except artists.

I cannot go into mezzotints—the beautiful
<i>manière noire</i>, in which the plate, as I have said,
is covered with a multitude of little points made
by rocking a cradlelike instrument armed with
// 230.png





// 231.png



// 232.png
.pn 215
sharp teeth over the plate in every direction. The
holes made in the plate hold the ink, and it will print
quite solid black. And the design is drawn on the
plate with scrapers and burnishers scraping and
burnishing the points away, making the drawing by
polishing and scraping the design on the face of the
plate, drawing the design from dark to light with
scrapers.

Nor can I take up steel engraving. This like
wood engraving is scarcely practiced today. The
steel engraver works very much in the same
fashion as the wood engraver. To do good work
is as difficult by one method as the other and that
is one reason why so little of it is done. Steel is
little used for etching or dry point. It is too
hard and unsympathetic; but when large editions
from copper plates are wanted, each plate has a
coating, a facing of steel deposited on it by electroplating,
and any number of prints can be pulled.

There is another charm about etching, too, and
that is the collecting of old paper. You cannot
imagine anything more delightful than the chase up
and down in old rag shops which used to exist before
the war, and in old book shops, hunting for old
paper. A paper which is old does take ink very
much better than modern paper. Possibly we are
making equally good paper today, but a paper
that has the beautiful tone of time on it, and the
beautiful watermarks that some of those old makers
put in it, is something which, when you can find it,
you want to treasure.

I have found paper in all the old Italian towns
and many of the French towns, and also in Holland.
The French, Italian, and Dutch papers were perfectly
beautiful and wonderfully made, and they are
// 233.png
.pn 216
delightful to print on. Often you can draw on
them, but we etchers do not like to see them wasted
for that purpose, so we preserve all the paper that
we can find. But I am afraid that in the war there
has been a great deal of good paper destroyed.
For example, some of the modern mills north of
Venice are now ruined, and any amount of paper,
and not only paper, but works of art—for the
making of good paper was a work of art—are
gone with the towns and the people and can never
be replaced.

Here is another proof I have made. There is
not enough ink on that. It would probably come
up, but it has not enough ink yet. The plate would
have to be inked three or four times, printed three
or four times, before I could get the proper strength
and color out of it. And the getting of the ink
right, the making of the different strengths of ink,
is an art in itself, and it requires the most endless
practice, and practice every time you try to print,
because printing ink changes just as much as nitric
acid. And every change in the weather has an
effect. But it is a most fascinating art. And one
of the great reasons why it is so fascinating is the
uncertainty, and if you are not fascinated with that
sort of thing you will never be an etcher.

We could go on, but I think the time is far past,
and I do not think I will keep you any longer.
Besides I have made and printed an etching. Now
go and work yourselves—for if I have not interested
you enough to do so, we have wasted the afternoon.

THE GRAPHIC ARTS LITHOGRAPHY|THE ARTISTS FIFTH LECTURE TUESDAY
.ce
APRIL 20 1920

In the previous lectures in which I tried to tell
you something about wood cutting, engraving,
and etching, I told you that those forms of the
graphic arts dated back almost to the beginning of
time, especially wood cutting, and that etching was
invented early in the Middle Ages. I said the evolution
of those forms of art took long, and the
methods were, in the case of wood engraving, obscure,
but of etching we know considerably more.

This afternoon I want to tell you about lithography.
And of lithography we know everything
about its invention, why it was invented, who
invented it, how the work was done. And that inventor
was such a great man in his own way that
nothing at all has been discovered since his day
// 235.png
.pn 218
regarding lithography save the application of the
steam press and photography to it.

The art was invented between the years 1796 and
1798, by a German musician and playwright,
Alois Senefelder. Senefelder was not in a very
flourishing condition at that time, and he tried to
find some way of engraving or reproducing and
printing his plays and his music. He searched for a
long time vaguely, because he was suffering from
exactly the same thing that you are—there were
no technical schools at that time in Germany, and
he had to invent everything for himself—though
I scarcely believe that many of you would take the
trouble to do that. Senefelder invented what
he thought was lithography, stone printing, in the
year 1796, but it was not lithography at all, only
the art of engraving on stone, just as Blake was
engraving on metal in England about the same time.

Senefelder had no idea that he was an artist,
though he later attempted to become one. His
desire was to print his music from stone plates,
which he thought would be cheaper than copper.

He made his drawings and wrote his music with a
greasy ink which he invented, writing the notes
backward on the stone. And when they were
written he poured nitric acid on the face of the
stone, just as Blake did, and the ink, which was
an acid-resisting varnish, like etching ground, protected
the parts of the stone drawn on, and bit
and reduced the undrawn-on parts and left the
notes of the music standing in relief.

He had not discovered anything, for if he had
taken the trouble to go into the nearest churchyard
in Munich he would have found this form of engraving
on tombstones dating from the time of
// 236.png
.pn 219
Dürer. He did not take up art; so far as is known,
this is the only drawing that he ever made—a
study of a house afire—and beyond its historic
importance I do not think it amounts to much
except to prove he was not much of an artist.
It was done in the same way as his music. He
found out that he was not on the right track, and
after thousands of experiments, as he says in his
book, <i>The Grammar of Lithography</i>—for everything
that he did is described in that book—he found
another method.

In trying to get his music and his plays on the
stone it occurred to Senefelder on one occasion—or
as he says, after thousands of experiments—that if
he made his drawing or writing with the greasy
ink with which he drew on paper, and then transferred
that drawing from the paper to the stone, and
then if it came off from the paper to the stone why
could he not transfer it back again on to the paper,
and so get a print. He tried and succeeded and
lithography was invented.

He interested his artist friend, Strixner, who made
this drawing with pen and ink—the greasy ink
made of tallow and grease dissolved in water—on a
piece of paper, and he took that paper and laid it
face down on the stone and ran it through a copper
plate press, of a very primitive sort, like one of those
I showed you on the screen the other day, and the
drawing came off of the paper on to the stone. And
it then occurred to him that if he were to dampen the
stone, put some more ink on the face of it, lay a piece
of paper over it, and run it again through the press,
the drawing might come off again on to the paper.

He tried and it did, and that is the whole of
lithography. The surface of the stone or plate is
// 237.png
.pn 220
neither raised nor lowered, the lines are neither in
intaglio nor relief, the print is made from the flat
surface.

As I told you, a wood engraving or a wood cut is
made by putting ink on lines which project above
the rest of the lowered block. Etching, as I also
pointed out to you, is made by cutting or biting
lines into a plate which print when inked. But in
lithography there is no engraving or etching. The
lines are flat on the surface and the drawing prints
because grease attracts grease and repels water. It
is a chemical action and his name for it was chemical
printing. The drawing which the artist makes
on paper or on stone or on a metal plate is not bitten
into relief or cut into the plate. It is a multiplication
of the original drawing which the artist made,
not a reproduction. And this is the whole of lithography;
and the difference between it and all the other
graphic arts. It is not an engraving, not a reproduction
of a work of art, but a multiplication of it.
It is the simplest and the most artistic method that
has ever been invented or ever practiced.

Soon after Senefelder showed to Strixner and
other contemporary German artists the merit of the
method, it was taken up, and the first thing that
was done was the publication of <i>Galleries</i>, as they
were called—portfolios of copies of the pictures in
the German galleries.

This pen drawing is a reproduction of Dürer’s
<i>Missal of Maximilian</i>. That was the first book
that was produced by lithography. There are
many pages of reproductions of the decorations
of the missal, a portrait of Dürer, and other matter.

German artists in the early days of the last
century did some extraordinary work, but Senefelder,
// 238.png
.pn 221
as I said, was not an artist, but a clever business
man. His idea, in the main, was not the making
of works of art, but of printing from calico, and in
order to do that he went to that commercial nation
called Great Britain, where he thought he would
have more success than he would have in Germany.
He took out patents for his invention in his own
country and England. But in England he fell
among artists, and the artists were delighted with
the method, and among those who practiced it were
West and Blake. And here is a print by Blake.

The only thing needful about lithography is that
you have to know how to draw, if you are going to
make a lithograph, you have to know how to draw
to make even an etching or a wood engraving.
You may not have to do that in order to make an
oil painting, but you do to make a work of art.
In these last days this is not always insisted upon
by incompetents who cannot draw.

Blake made this design, and this one alone.
Why he made no more I have no idea. It is a
very successful and characteristic one. As you will
see, all an artist’s character and technique come
out in lithography, because there is no translation,
no reproduction, no change. The lines print as
the artist drew them.

.ca PAGE 221  TITLE-PAGE OF THE “GRAMMAR OF LITHOGRAPHY”

A few years afterward—I think it was about 1816—Senefelder
published his treatise on the subject,
<i>The Grammar of Lithography</i>, and that book is the
authority to this day. Everything that we know
about lithography is in its pages; the only two
things which have been discovered since are the
application of the steam press to printing lithographs,
and photography, by which they are at
times transferred to the stone.
// 239.png
.pn 222

The art in the beginning was not called “lithography,”
but as you see there, “stone printing.”
That was not even the original English name for it.
It was called the very simple and compact one of
“polyautography,” which did not catch on very
well, but it describes the art perfectly—“many auto-writings.”
It is the multiplication of drawings
and writings, and not the reproduction of them, as
are all the other graphic arts.

Senefelder, however, after obtaining his patent
and recognition, though he had many difficulties
and adventures in London, soon went back to
Germany.

“GRAMMAR OF LITHOGRAPHY.”  LITHOGRAPH

This slide shows a very curious plate by Samuel
Prout (Page 224), published in the English translation
of <i>The Grammar of Lithography</i> in 1818. It is curious
because it shows the earliest method; it proves
that at the beginning the drawing was not made on
the stone but made on paper, and transferred to
the stone. And Senefelder himself says in his
book that for artists this is the most valuable
discovery in lithography, because the artist will
be able to go out of doors to make his drawings on
paper, have them transferred to stone and printed
as he could in no other way. This pen drawing by
Prout was done in that fashion.

Almost immediately artists of eminence began
to take up the art, and one of the first was Géricault.
He was living in London about the time that Senefelder
was there, and made this drawing, which was
one of a series of prints of the favorite form of
British recreation of that day. That form of
recreation has been transferred to this country, and
among the greatest heroes is a gentleman who
recently arrived in this country from France and is

creating more interest than Maeterlinck or Lodge.
However, we will not consider that matter of public
taste so much as the extraordinary way in which
Géricault did this drawing. The upper part of this
figure is done in pen and ink, the legs and the body
in chalk, and the reverse is the case in the other
figure. This proves how quickly artists recognized
the possibilities of the art. The drawing was done in
1805 or 1806.

But all artists who saw the new form of art began
to practice it, and the portfolios and albums and
galleries which came out shortly afterward contain
some of the most perfect lithographs, although even
at that early date some of the artists, especially
the Germans, began to get that lithographic quality
in their drawings which we all so hate and loathe, and
which you see in the commercial lithographs about
you—the perfection of technique, the destruction
of art.

Lithography spread very rapidly over Europe,
and got as far as Spain, and Goya, whose work I
showed you last week in aquatint, made a number
of lithographs, finding it a most congenial method.
This lithograph (Page 226), one of a series of “Bull
Fights,” is deservedly famous. It was brought very
early to this country, but very little artistically was
done here.

DRAWING SCRATCHED FROM BLACK TO WHITE LIKE MEZZOTINT.\
LITHOGRAPH

Then the art went back to France, where two or
three men began to practice it with great success.
One of them was Charlet, and this drawing (Page
229) is curious, because it shows another method by
which a lithograph can be made. It is evident that
the stone was entirely covered with a film of ink, and,
if it had been printed before any drawing was put
on it, it would have been perfectly black all over.
// 245.png
.pn 228
Charlet then either took a scraper or a knife and
scraped the design in white line out of the black
surface as the mezzotinter does.

There is no limit to the methods which can be
employed. The number and variety of them are
only now just beginning to be known.

Another artist who at the same time began to
practice it was Raffet. And these two, Charlet and
Raffet, invented between them what is known now
as the “Napoleonic Legend.” Their stunning drawings
of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars were
sold then as propaganda throughout France, and
some of them got to England, and over here.

I know of nothing finer in early lithographs
than this design of Raffet’s of the “Nocturnal
Review.”

.ca PAGE 228  A. RAFFET: ILS GROGNAIENT MAIS ILS SUIVAIENT TOUJOURS.\

There is still another, “The Retreat from Moscow,”
“<i>Ils grognaient mais ils suivaient toujours</i>” (Page 226),
which is equally fine. And all of these designs were
published in very popular form and sold for a few sous
apiece, and were widely circulated all over Europe.
They were about a foot in length, and were issued
a dozen or so in a portfolio.

.ca PAGE 231  R. BONINGTON: RUE DU GROS-HORLOGE.  LITHOGRAPH

But the art was used for other purposes than
popular propaganda. An Englishman named Baron
Taylor early in the last century, about 1825 or
1830, went to France and began to publish an
illustrated description of the country, and he got
the most eminent artists of France and England to
work for him. He obtained government support
and began to issue his <i>Picturesque France</i>.[#] One
of these artists was Richard Bonington, and Bonington
made, in one of the volumes of this great work,

<i>Voyages pittoresques et romantiques de l’ancienne France.</i>

.pn 231
this fine drawing of the “Gros-Horloge” in the street
at Rouen, one of the masterpieces of the art (Page 230).

Bonington experimented for himself, and in a
very short time he made a series of drawings in
chalk and in wash, which have never been surpassed
to this day. He was one of the greatest of the
lithographers, and one of the earliest. As in the
other forms of the graphic arts new artists appeared
with new methods.

.ca PAGE 231  E. ISABEY: RETURN TO PORT.  LITHOGRAPH

Another man who worked at the same time as
Bonington on these volumes was Isabey who treated
mainly the seaports of France in the most realistic
fashion. Not only that, he made a series of designs in
a portfolio of marine subjects. None of the mezzotints
I showed you the other day rivals this in drawing,
in color, or in handling (Page 233). It is only
a small chalk drawing, some six or eight inches long,
but it enlarges wonderfully, and gives you an amazing
effect of form, of the movement of the sea, and
the color of water and sky done in the simplest way,
just with a piece of chalk, the whole design drawn on
paper or stone. Probably this drawing was made
on stone, because these artists made their sketches
out of doors, brought them back to their studios, and
worked them up on the stone, this being the easiest
way, as the paper which Senefelder prepared for
drawing on, was not reliable.

.pm il 250b 300 Page_233b
.ca PAGE 231  H. DAUMIER: RUE DU TRANSNONAIN.  LITHOGRAPH

Another great man who also practiced the art very
extensively was Daumier. And this design (Page 233)
was published, I think, in <i>Charivari</i>—I am not certain—and
is one of the episodes of the French Revolution
of 1848. For making that drawing, which was a
sort of satire on the horrors of the Revolution of '48,
Daumier was promptly put in prison, and when he
got there he employed himself not in weeping or
// 249.png
.pn 232
wailing, but in drawing portraits of his fellow-prisoners.
This is about as wonderful a sample of
portrait design in lithography as I know of, and
it proves the fact that an artist who is an artist will
find his subjects always about him—whether in
prison or in heaven or somewhere else; all he wants
is a sheet of paper and a piece of lithographic chalk
to prove it so.

.pm il 251 223 Page_234
.ca PAGE 232  A. GAVARNI: PÈRE VIRELOQUE.  LITHOGRAPH

A third man who took up the art at this time
was Gavarni. Gavarni is mostly known as a
draughtsman of fashion and of costume and events,
and this masque ball is a good example of his work.
But he was not satisfied with that alone, and he
made many portraits of many people, among
them the De Goncourt brothers. And besides that
he also made a series of portfolios of folk-lore, and
popular legends, and this figure, Père Vireloque
(Page 234), is taken from one of them. And I would
like you to notice the extraordinary way that this
drawing on stone was handled, the extraordinary
quality and character that Gavarni gets in all of his
work, the difference between the tottering creature,
and the firm ground, the handling and the modeling
of the figure. The technical work is beyond belief
in the variety of the textures that he has got out of
that stone or plate on which the drawing was
made.

Hervier made this drawing in a different way from
any other that I have shown you. It was made
entirely in wash—for you can work in any way at
all, on paper transferred to stone, or on the stone
itself. The wash is made from the greasy chalk
which the artist uses, dissolved in water as you
dissolve india ink or solid water colors and the
artist uses the dissolved chalk like water color.

And it might be just as well if I told you at this
moment the theory of lithography, which I have
not done yet. It is so simple, and the drawings are
so easily made, that I almost forgot it. The theory
is this, that if you take a piece of greasy chalk, and
draw either on the stone, or on paper, and transfer it
to stone, and then dampen that stone and take some
more of the greasy chalk made into ink with varnish
or oil, on a roller, very much like the one that I
showed you the other day for printing etchings, for
inking the plates, and roll more greasy ink on to
the dampened stone, the ink will only adhere to
the greasy drawing which is on the stone, and the
water with which the stone is washed repels the
grease, while the grease attracts the ink (which is
also grease), and then when the paper is put on the
face of it and run through the press the print comes off
on the paper. The whole is chemical affinity, nothing
else. It is simply the affinity of grease for grease and
the repulsion of grease by water. That is the whole
principle, and the whole theory, and the whole practice
of the art.

.ca PAGE 237  E. DELACROIX: THE LION OF THE ATLAS.  LITHOGRAPH

It is so simple that for many years it fell into
the hands of the commercial lithographer, and one
of the first of these, although he was a very great
printer, was Lemercier, and he did more to advance
lithography during the middle of the last century
than anyone else in France. But he did another
thing: He made a secret of lithography, invented all
sorts of mysteries and surrounded the art with them.
But in France the artists continued to use it, and this
“Lion” of Delacroix (Page 235) is a design that
justly ranks as a masterpiece of drawing and printing.

Here is a print by Linnell, done in England, showing
quite clearly the difference between the work of
// 255.png
.pn 238
the artists of the two countries. The art migrated
from England to France and back to England again,
just as in the case of wood engraving.

Here is a drawing by Cattermole, a wash drawing
which shows the difference between English
and French drawing, when artists tried to be themselves
and not imitate the popular man of the
moment, as most artless duffers do today. Lane
was another English artist and portrait painter who
practiced the art in England. In those days he
could get all the sitters he wanted to pose for lithographed
portraits. But today we have advanced
so far in art that if we want a portrait made—we go
to a photographer. Then, too, lithography occupied
in the salons and drawing-rooms the same place
and the same importance as bridge. People then
cared for art instead of talking about it—or hearing
it talked about.

But it was treated in many ways. For example,
it was used by men who one would not suppose
were caricaturists. It was used by Sandys, whose
wood engravings I showed you in the first lecture.
Sandys made this extraordinary pen drawing, one of
the finest that has been done on zinc, and it was
published as a caricature and produced somewhat
of a sensation. It may surprise you to know that
he was so absolutely reckless that he made a drawing
on this plate; and that it was supposed to
represent John Ruskin as the ass, and on his back
are Millais, Rossetti, and Holman Hunt, the pre-Raphaelite
brotherhood, while Titian and Tintoretti
you can see in the distance singing <i>ora pro nobis</i>. The
whole design was a burlesque on Millais’ “Sir Isumbras
at the Ford.” And Ruskin, the prophet, and
Hunt, the serious one, got into such a fury that they

endeavored to prosecute the maker of it for libel, but
as he was careful not to sign his name they did not
find out for some years who did it. But technically
it was a very remarkable drawing, and it
lives because of its excellence, in drawing and
printing.

Lithography, as I said, fell into the hands of the
commercial lithographer and for years few artists
practiced it. But the man who revived it in Germany
was Adolph von Menzel. As I told you of the
draughtsmen on wood, all these artists were so keen
for the technique of any art that they practiced every
form of art which appeared, and Menzel did more in
Germany to make it into an original form of art than
any who had gone before him. Those drawings
for his volume on <i>The Uniforms of Frederick the
Great’s Army</i> were all in pen and ink, and done on
the stone. But he carried lithography farther than
anyone had; in this “Christ in the Temple” he
produced a masterpiece. It has been drawn in
almost every way, drawn on stone, with ink and
pen, and with wash and chalk all combined. I have
shown you nothing in which such an amazing lot
of types have been so truly rendered as this lithograph
by Menzel. I am sorry that scarcely any
of these prints that I have shown you are in the
print room. They ought to be. For you must have
good examples to study if you wish to do good work,
and carry on good tradition.

one of a series of designs he made for a portfolio
called <i>Sketches with Chalk on Stone</i>. It has all the

it is a lithograph. In fact some of these designs so
closely resemble mezzotints and aquatints that even

this morning I was shown in O’Brien’s place some
of these early lithographs which I could not tell
myself, as the plate marks were cut off, whether
they were really lithographs, as Mr. O’Brien maintained,
or whether they were aquatints. At first
I thought they were aquatints, but they may possibly
be lithographs, though probably the artist, knowing
about aquatint, used some form of it, in some way,
on stone.

Here is another example of modern German
work by Otto Fischer. You see again the artist
has not lost a single bit of character, the character
of his handling, or his technique, or method of
expression. You are not cramped in the slightest
in your drawing when you make a lithograph.

Here is one by Otto Greiner, done entirely in
pen and ink, a remarkable example of brilliant
drawing, freely done, in which the character of his
work is perfectly preserved.

Another man who took up the art a little later than
Menzel was Fantin-Latour (Pages 235 and 236); he
practiced it for years, and revived the art in France.
You all know his paintings of roses and his subject
pictures, and his lithographs are equally well known.
Nothing could be more beautiful than those roses.
He loved drawing, and practiced lithography because
he loved it, because it gave him line and color.
He kept on for years, until the close of his life,
either working at flowers or symphonies, which he
rendered in lithography, as well as in oil.

There is another thing about his lithographs.
I do not know whether you can tell it from this one,
but in many of them you can see that these drawings
were made on paper, Michelet charcoal paper. You
see the lines of the paper and the watermark which
// 262.png
.pn 245
you find in all Michelet charcoal paper in the prints.
Fantin-Latour made all his drawings on paper, took
them to the printer, ran them through the printing-press,
when they came off on the stone, and then
printed them as Senefelder did. You cannot make
any change in the drawing, if you make it on paper,
but you can make any change you want to as soon
as it is transferred to the stone. You can add or
erase with perfect freedom.

You remember I showed you some of Félicien
Rops’s aquatints the other day. He was equally
remarkable in lithography. He did a vast number
of plates, and published a remarkable magazine some
forty or fifty years ago. Here are subjects (Pages 241
and 242) showing that he was a perfect master of his
medium, able to use it any way he wanted.

Henri De Groux was another Belgian, a mystic
or a “horrorist,” and, although he died before the
war, still he carried out in some of his works horrors
which, had he lived, he would have seen his country
undergo; his country’s misfortunes might have been
forever recorded.

Jean François Millet practiced it too. Every
artist tried it. And here you can see, those of you
who know his etchings and his wood blocks, how
freely and quickly and easily Millet worked. There
is no difficulty about lithography at all, except the
difficulty of drawing; if you can draw you can lithograph.
There is no practice necessary at all, except
the endless practice that an artist needs all his life
to carry on to develop his art.

You remember that “Raven” by Manet, drawn
in line, which I showed you last week. Here is a
portrait (Page 240) equally freely done, done in
lithography. It was freely done with a brush—it
// 263.png
.pn 246
looks like it—with a little bit of chalk work put in
maybe.

Here is another wash drawing, and a very remarkable
one by Lunois. These drawings were printed
in color; color can be added to lithographs; Senefelder
showed how to do that, the same way as the
Japanese made their color blocks, only far more
directly, as there were no wood blocks to cut.

But there is another thing about lithography
in distinction from etching and engraving. When
you make an etching you have no idea what you are
going to get until the plate is printed, and then
you frequently get a shock. In lithography you can
see everything you do the whole while you are doing
it. Your drawing grows under your fingers just
exactly as any other drawing, and you know it will
print just as you drew it, and that is the reason
why lithography fell into the hands of the commercial
lithographer who wrapped it up in mystery because
the technique was so simple, so direct, so easy that
even he could practice it.

Those of you who remember that wonderful study
upstairs will see that Carriére preserved his methods
in this print just as much as he has in his paintings.

French poster. This head is after Henri Martin

Steinlen also took up the art (Page 249), and in
his pages for <i>Gil Blas Illustré[**literally Illustre’]</i> and other magazines
he made a series of drawings well worth study. You
must study the work of all these brilliant technicians.

Lithography was used as war propaganda,
in the last war as well as in the time of Napoleon.
You have seen the French posters as well as our own.

Forain and Steinlen were trained lithographers,
and when war came on they made use of the art
for the benefit of their country. You will see this
all through Forain’s war work, and the books that he
illustrated before the war and in the pages of <i>Figaro</i>.

This is one of Forain’s designs (Page 250) done
during the war. Almost all of his drawings that you
see in <i>Figaro</i> are done with lithographic chalk or pen
and ink. They are made, as I told you, into photo-engravings.
Abel Favre made the most celebrated
poster (Page 248) that was done during the war—“On
les aura!” its meaning was plain to all who could see.

There is one thing I want to tell you about these
posters, and that is that the French artists who made
them knew exactly what they were doing and what
they wanted to do, because they were technically
trained craftsmen.

The design was made by the artist not as a
water color or an oil painting, but as a drawing right
straight on paper or on stone in lithographic chalk—if
on paper, transferred to stone, or on the stone
itself. For all those men in England, in France, in
Italy, and also in Germany—I suppose they must
have had posters, although I have not seen any of
them—knew absolutely how to work for lithographic
printing.

Maris lithographed his Dutch landscapes. This
looks exactly like his wash or charcoal drawing, but

he has kept all the character of any of his work in
other media.

.pm il 282 300 Page_265
.ca PAGE 252  MARIUS A. F. BAUER: THE SPHINX.  LITHOGRAPH

Another man who took up lithography was Bauer
(Page 265), also a Dutchman, who is better known by
his paintings and etchings. Yet whether that Sphinx
was done in Egypt or not, he has made a remarkable
record of it. It was also done with remarkable
technical knowledge and skill.

Veth, still another Dutchman, has used the
craft very brilliantly. Here is a portrait of the
reviver of lithography, Menzel, in his old age.
Menzel did a considerable amount of work which I
have not shown you, but it is all well worth studying,
and reproductions of much of it are in the
Ryerson Library.

The third man who took up lithography and
practiced it more than Menzel or Fantin-Latour
was Whistler, and this is one of his earliest designs.
It was drawn on stone, because at that time the
printer Way was very anxious to get Whistler to
work for him, and he was good enough to supply
Whistler not only with stones, but with wheelbarrows
and with men to wheel them about, because a stone
even a foot long, as this is, and three inches thick,
weighs a lot, and the artist cannot very easily lug
it around. Whistler found this out in his first
experiments after he had made two or three drawings
on stone; this one is done with pen, with brush,
and with wash.

From the very beginning he began to experiment,
and experimented in many ways that no one had
tried before him. He found right away that if he
wanted to draw out of doors, as he always did, from
nature, and did not have his men and his wheelbarrows
around, it was impossible, so he began to
// 270.png
.pn 253
use paper. The paper that he had at that time was
horrible stuff, and I speak from a horrible experience,
which he had too. But he mastered that paper.
It was covered with a shiny grain, and it was a
nasty sticky substance, and it was one of the most
difficult things in the world to work on; yet he made
on that paper this charming design, one of a number,
and this design was published in a paper called the
<i>Whirlwind</i>, which was issued in London; so little
was the lithograph cared for that it was given away,
not as the Japanese color prints I told you about the
other day with a pound of tea, from which Whistler
learned about the nocturnes, but they could not
give this paper containing Whistler’s prints away;
it was sold as waste paper. And now collectors
give pounds to get that very drawing, when they
can find it—a drawing they would not have when
he made it, though it used to sell for a penny.

Whistler knew that his lithographs had the same
artistic value as his etchings. He devoted the
same care and skill to them, but people thought
otherwise at that time, but now they have come
around to his way of thinking.

This drawing of Stéphane Mallarmé was done
on another kind of paper, on smooth Japanese
transfer paper. I happened to be with him when he
made it. And although that drawing looks as
though it were knocked right off—the drawing itself,
when he got it right did not take very long—he put
piece of transfer paper over transfer paper, tore
them up, and started afresh and all the while he
kept poor Mallarmé posing, and he kept on for two
or three weeks until he got this remarkable portrait,
which was published as the frontispiece of
Mallarmé’s volume of verse.
// 271.png
.pn 254

Whistler experimented in all sorts of ways, and
with all sorts of subjects. As he used to say, he was
no landscape painter or portrait painter or figure
painter, but he was an artist. He said “the man
who cannot draw or paint everything, cannot draw or
paint anything,” and he proved the truth of his
proposition by this study of a shoeing forge, drawn
as well as any man could who devotes himself to
the study of horses. That was done on paper—the
greater number of his lithographs are on paper.
Many of his drawings were made in Paris, and when
finished the sheet of paper was sent over to London
to his printer, Way, and there put down on the stone.

But you must know at this time the secrecy in
the art of lithography was so great that Whistler,
during the whole of his lifetime, had no idea how
drawings were put on to the stone, or how they were
etched, or printed. The etching is nothing but
washing the stone with acid to keep the lines from
spreading.

But the drawing made on paper was sent over to
London, and then transferred to the stone, and
when it was put on the stone, sometimes half the
work was lost, and Whistler had to go to London,
get the stone, and draw on it again the work which
the printer had lost, in order to get the effect
that he had in the beginning on paper. Had he
been allowed to go into the printing office and see
the drawing transferred, etched, and printed, we
should have had more lithographs and even better
lithographs than we have today from him. These
hindrances drove him and many other artists from
lithography.

Finally some of us broke open the door of
the lithograph shops and we found that the secret
// 272.png
.pn 255
of lithography consisted mostly of stale beer and
lemon juice, conservatism, and stupidity. It was
with such secrets that the craft was surrounded.
And it is in ways of this sort that most of the
secrets of the arts are hidden.

There are several architectural subjects by
Whistler, astounding studies of architecture done
by him a little before he died. Look at the wonderful
way the “Church of St. Anne’s,” that old
Georgian church in Soho, is drawn and the feeling
of a dreary, dark day given. I remember the afternoon
he came into my place and said he had seen
the subject, and in about two hours he was back with
the drawing on a piece of paper. He had gone out,
done the whole thing, and that same afternoon we
went over to the printer’s and it was put on a stone
and printed. As I shall show you on Thursday,
a lithograph can be made more rapidly than an
etching.

LITHOGRAPH

Here is a portrait he made of me, in a very short
time, the result of a lifetime of practice (Page 257).
As I sat in a chair in front of the fire in my place
in London, and he sat on the floor with his back to
the fire and worked until he could scarcely see, so
great was the darkness, yet he kept the feeling of
firelight in the coming twilight in a most remarkable
fashion. He kept on working till he could scarcely
see, for he used to say there is so much to do, and so
little time to do it.

This is one of the last, if not the last, of the plates
he did. It was done under most trying circumstances—when
his wife was ill—in the Savoy Hotel,
looking out of the window across the Thames;
it is the most perfect of the wash drawings he did.
It was all done in wash, exactly as a water color, on
// 273.png
.pn 256
the stone, not transferred to it, and it was scraped
and burnished and then redrawn over and over
again until he got the effect he wanted. But it
was not done easily or quickly or simply. There is
very much work on the stone, for the first proofs were
very poor indeed, black and smeared, though he
never was daunted by that, but kept on with his
work until he got the result that he wanted; and
out of this plate he made one of his finest lithographs.

Sargent has made a few lithographs. This
was done on paper. And I have often wondered
why he has not done more, because in the first
and almost the only design he ever made, he made a
great success. And I cannot help wondering, as
I said a little while ago, why people who want their
portraits drawn do not get an artist to do it in
lithography. As I have shown you, it is a most
beautiful form of art, and here is a proof that anyone
who can draw, as Sargent can, can make a
fine lithograph on his first attempt. F. Walter
Taylor is beginning to do portraits, and I hope he
may go on.

extent to making theatrical posters, like Beardsley—however,
in his own way.

This is a portrait of Mr. George Bernard Shaw.
It is better looking than Mr. Shaw is now, and it is
rather a good design by Rothenstein. I wonder that
Shaw has not taken to lithography himself. He has
tried everything and succeeded in a few things,
especially in advertising.

Brangwyn (Page 259) also has done a great deal in
lithography. And all the men whose work I am now
going to show you are artists who have been trained
in lithography.

When it was found at the beginning of the war
that we had not an artist in the United States of
America who was able to make marine subjects in
lithography, the government had to send to Europe,
to London, to have a drawing made which would
print. Nobody knew how to do it here, in this
highly enlightened country of ours which is full of
artists. The government could not get an artist
who could make a marine drawing which could be
put on the stone and printed at once. So they had
to send to London to have the drawing made by an
Englishman, and that drawing was sent here in a
British dispatch box, and was put on the stone
by the American Lithographing Company, and
prints were made of it in a few hours after it arrived.

There is an example of our utter unpreparedness
in art when we went into the war.

.pm il 277 230 Page_260
.ca PAGE 261  MUIRHEAD BONE: THE SHIPYARD.  LITHOGRAPH

There were a number of other Englishmen who
took up lithography as propaganda work, and here is
a design by one of them, Muirhead Bone (Page 260),
a most original design, in composition and arrangement.
The top of this great crane looks down on a
shipyard. Before the war Bone had not made
// 279.png
.pn 262
a single lithograph. He took up the art and made a
success of it, and did a great service to his country.

But at the same time he, and I believe all the
other men, went to the printer’s and saw that the
drawing was properly put on the stone and properly
printed. And that is what scarcely anyone takes
the trouble to do in this country. Most of you
students are afraid of soiling your lily-white hands.

During the war we artists who were connected
with the Bureau of Public Information, the Pictorial
Division, had about five hundred painters and
illustrators working for us, and do you know, out
of that five hundred there were not five Americans
who knew how to make a lithograph at all, or even
how to make a drawing which did not have to be
copied, redrawn, or photographed. This technical
ignorance was an enormous loss of time in government
propaganda, and an enormous waste of government
money, because all the work that these
untrained patriots did had to be done over. You
had a most excellent Division here in Chicago, but
scarcely a man knew how to make his drawings.

This design (Page 263), also a war drawing, is by
Spencer Pryse. It was made on a zinc plate, as I remember,
and he proved it and printed it and saw to the
whole thing. And unless you students care enough
about your art to do that, to care for your drawings
and print them, when you get a lithograph press, the
sooner you get out of art into something else, the
better it will be for yourselves; art can get on very
well without you.

Another English war artist was Nevinson (Page
264). These drawings, as I understand, were not
done at the front, because no artist did anything immediately
at the front, for there was nothing there to

do, nothing to do but to keep your head under cover.
When you got to the front, as I saw it, there was
nothing to see and if you stuck your head up you
might lose it. But most of these British drawings
were done some five or ten miles behind the lines.

There was another thing about this British
propaganda work. Do you know that the British
and the French governments did more for their
artists over here than we did for ours? The best
of the work that was done was sent over here to
show what Great Britain was doing. The United
States government did not have enough knowledge of
how to exploit itself to send the work that we did even
around this country. None of it but some of my
own ever got to Europe during the war; it has
not got over there yet. And that is altogether
due to the fact that we have no art head, no art
direction, no Secretary of Art, no Art Department
in the United States. And I hope that before we
go into another war, before we do anything more,
we will have an Art Department in this country.
We must have it. We are bound to have it. Or we
have got to give up talking about art, because
we are rapidly becoming, owing to the want of
government protection of art, one of the most
artless countries on the face of the earth. The
government thinks art a luxury—it is a financial
asset.

Only today, I believe, there is a committee or a
commission in Chicago begging for funds to start,
in the American Academy in Rome, a department
of music. Is it not a pretty spectacle for the
United States, when the American Academy, so-called,
of Fine Arts in Rome, and of Archeology and
Classical Studies has to send private people out to
// 285.png
.pn 268
beg for money, that we ought to be able to demand
from the state! The state should furnish that
money, and should support that Academy. We
have a very fine Academy in Rome, just as the
French have an Academy and as the Spaniards and
the English have. But the Spanish public and the
French public are not asked to support their academies.
The governments pay for them, because they
know that art is a financial asset, as important as
big business and a great deal more so. We don’t
know enough to know how little we do know.

Another thing is that, although in our Academy
we are now to have all the branches of the fine arts,
there is one that we are not to have, the most important
of all, the one in which this country has made
the greatest name, and that is the practice and
teaching of the graphic arts. Every other country
has in its academy a school of graphic arts. We have
not. And yet it is in the graphic arts that the
United States has done its best work, as I think
you will admit after seeing a good many of these
slides. Until we get a school of graphic arts we
are simply out of competition with other countries.

And there is another matter. The pupils for
the French Academy in Rome are obtained in this
way: In France there are government art schools
in all the big provincial towns. And from those
art schools the best pupils are sent to Paris to study
in the École des Beaux Arts. And they have all in
their heads the hope that they may win the Prix de
Rome; when they have got that, they pass four
delightful years in Rome putting what they have
learned into practice. We have no such schools.
If a man does win the American prize, a studentship
in the American Academy, he wins it simply
// 286.png



// 287.png



// 288.png
.pn 271
without any tradition, without any definite system
of teaching, only because he can pass a certain
examination. And the best craftsman, the most
useful artist or art student, has but little chance
to win.

It is the duty of this country to organize national
schools in every great city in the land. We should
have in Washington a great national art university,
and from that national art university the best
students should be sent by the government to Rome
or Paris or the most inspiring centers of art work,
and then we will get some national art, and we
won’t get it in any other way.

American poster (Page 266), I believe, that was made
during the war, or one of them, and one of the most
artistic ones—at any rate, one of the most effective.
And it was made by a man who knew how to make

himself by working in a shop, and that is the
reason why the poster was so good, so effective, and
had such a very satisfactory result when books were

LITHOGRAPH

Here is the work of another man who also has
given much time to practical lithography, setting up
a press for himself—Mr. Bellows (Page 270), who was
here during the winter. He has carried out that study
of the “Murder of Edith Cavell” in a remarkable
fashion, though as he did not see it I rather prefer
this second slide, in which he has drawn something

that he has seen; I think this is a finer rendering of
something that he has seen, than the other, which he
has imagined. These two, however, are very interesting
lithographs, done by a very amusing man.

And a propos of this I show you this print for
another reason. It is a drawing I made in Venice in
1912—this is only the key block of it—which the
Venetian government used as a poster. But what
I wanted to tell you about it was that the drawing
was made from nature in Venice, taken to London
and put on stone without anybody working on it
except myself, and then transferred again; that is,
a copy of it was printed with very greasy ink, and
then it was packed up and sent to Italy and printed
there. No other artist, no engraver, no photographer,
had anything to do with it—the drawing as I

Here is another. This was one of the first
drawings that was made on paper and transferred
to stone in modern times and the original kept.
It is transferred extremely well technically, and I
want to show you next week exactly how that is
done. That was transferred and printed by Charles
Goulding, the brother of the etching printer in
London.

This is the shop in which I work (Page 286). It is
not so bad. And I work with that printer who
stands beside me. You can see the type he is and
the nationality he is. And every workman, almost,
in that shop is a German, and they have been there
for years; they were there all through the war,
though most of them, I suppose all of them, or
nearly all of them, are American citizens. But there
is not in that shop, or there was not before the
war, scarce an American-born lithographic prover or
// 290.png
.pn 273
artist, because there is not a single craft school,
except one in Cincinnati, where the art of lithography
is taught—the simplest art in the world—and yet
there is nobody who has taken the trouble in this
country to try to learn it, and we have to import
nearly all the trained lithographers that we have.

These are two forms of presses which are producing
in this country the most amazing results.
They are making really a new epoch and a new
era in lithography. I said that everything was in
Senefelder’s book, but this is the latest method of
work. The drawing is put on this flat bed, and
runs under this cylinder which is covered with a
rubber blanket, and the rubber blanket takes the
impression and transfers it on to the paper which
is upon the press. The same way, more or less,
in the other. That is what is known as the offset
method, a method which is going to produce in
the very near future a great revolution in lithography.
But I hope I have shown you in this talk
what wonderful work has been done, and next
week I want to show you exactly how it is done,
and how simple it is, and I hope that in the future
some of you will take it up.

MR. EGGERS[**F2: I believe this should be all caps-see next page]: I wanted particularly to say
a word in connection with this program,
because a proposition—I might almost have
said at one time a dream—which we have had in mind
at the Art Institute seems to be approaching realization.
Mr. Pennell is only one of those who have
urged doing things which are practical, doing things
which are more and more practical at the Institute
than the things which we have been doing, and
among these more practical realizations of the art
ideal is the development of a class in lithography.
Through the generous co-operation of the National
Association of Employing Lithographers, the Art
Institute is going to be able within a very few days,
I trust, to announce a class for the training of workers
in lithography.

There will be two phases to that work. There
is one which is distinctly an economic phase. The
country needs lithographers. It is willing to give
// 293.png
.pn 276
them occupation. It is willing to pay them well.
In other words, the technical lithographer is a man
who earns a good living and is sure of a job.

The other phase is that in lithography we have
a means of conveying to a large public the direct
touch of the artist in a work of art as we do not
convey it by any other form of reproduction, with
the exception, of course, of etching and wood-block
printing.

The lithograph is in a certain sense an autograph.
It is a comparatively young art, but already illustrious
names like Whistler’s, Mr. Pennell’s own, the
name of Bellows, Sterner, men of that type, have
been enrolled as great masters of that art, and
they have given that art a great impetus.

It is a great pleasure to introduce this afternoon’s
program in which we shall have a practical demonstration
of various practices of lithography.

MR. PENNELL: I think this announcement
by Mr. Eggers is most important, for it does show
what some of us have been trying to insist on, that
what is wanted in this country are practical technical
schools, and if you make a start, as you are going
to make here by a School of Lithography, you will
have done a great deal for the country, for the
Institute and for the students, and the last should
be first. My belief is this, and I know it is a practical
belief, and I have said that I do not believe
there is a single budding Rembrandt or Michelangelo,
or Whistler, or unseen genius in this audience. I
do not believe any one of you is going to turn out to
be anything of the sort. Yet some of you may.
That will be because you cannot be stopped. But
there is no reason why every student in this school
should not learn some craft by which, until you
// 294.png
.pn 277
become great artists, you can live. No matter
how great you may become, you are not going
straight to the top of the tree or the summit of the
mountain of fame. You will have to do a lot of
climbing, and the easier you make that climbing
for yourselves, or the easier it is made for you, the
better. And if as in climbing you have a rope—a
craft—to hang on to, the better it will be for you.

There is one other thing I want to say, and it is
that many of the most distinguished artists in this
country have started as lithographers, and I can
give you their names. One of the most brilliant
was John H. Twachtman. Some of his pictures are
upstairs in the galleries. Twachtman was trained
as a working lithographer. So were Shirlaw, Dielman,
Muhrmann, and many others. Most of
them learned their craft in the lithographic shop
of Strowbridge & Company in Cincinnati. They
made and saved enough money to go to Europe and
study their art. You are studying art here; you
have scholarships to depend on, but you have no
craftsmanship—those men of a past generation made
names for themselves by themselves—you have
every sort of help, denied them, but you have yet
to make a reputation as they did. That is the
aim of all artists.

Probably the greatest artist that America has
produced, and who stayed over here and did not
go to Europe to live was Winslow Homer. I do not
know to what extent Winslow Homer worked at
lithography, but he knew the art of lithography, and
he fell back on it when he wanted to publish some
of his drawings.

The most interesting thing that I have heard
since I have been here is the announcement of the
// 295.png
.pn 278
starting of this school of lithography by Mr. Eggers.
I am extremely glad that it is to be started. And you
are greatly indebted to the Art Institute of Chicago
which is now going to take up practical work, and
it will be your privilege to assist by practical study,
and then you will find that you will get practical
returns from it. It is not going to interfere with
your art work, but it is going to enable you to make
a livelihood out of your art, and you have to make a
living, most of you, I hope. If you can do it in
an artistic fashion, it is one of the greatest advantages
that you can have had from your school
training.

Now, to come to practical work. I told you the
other day that when Senefelder invented lithography
he had two things in mind: One was the printing of
his plays and music in some simpler and cheaper
form than by engraving on copper. The other
was calling the attention of artists to the new craft.
Mr. Eggers made one mistake in his most important
announcement today, though he did try to correct
himself, when he said that lithography was a form
of reproduction like etching or wood engraving. As
a matter of fact, it is nothing of the sort. It is not
a reproductive art. It is the art of multiplication,
while all the other graphic arts, as I have been telling
you for the last five lectures, are reproductive arts.
Lithography is the art of multiplying originals and
not of reproducing them.

Drawings from the beginning of lithography were
made by artists on paper or on stone. Senefelder
was always trying to get some substitute for the
heavy stone, and his first attempt, and successful
attempt, more or less, was in making what he called
“stone paper.” That was a sort of paper which
// 296.png
.pn 279
was coated with powdered stone, and this gave a
grain to the drawing made on it. It was not a
success, though used for a while.

And the next thing he tried was metal plates.
I am not certain to what extent he succeeded, but,
as I showed you last time, most of the early lithographs
were copies done in the artist’s studio or in
the printing-office, and stones were used for two
reasons: Because the artist did not have to take
them out of doors, and also because when you
make a drawing on stone or on a metal plate, you
know what you are doing, and the design so made
should print.

There is this difference between lithography and
the other graphic arts. When you make an etching,
as I think I told you last week, but it is worth
repeating—you first draw on the zinc or copper
plate, but that is not the etching, not the end; you
must bite the drawing and print it. In lithography
the drawing that you make on the paper, on the
plate of zinc, or on stone, you will see—or you
should, if it comes off—comes out as a print exactly
as you drew it. It is not reproduced, or changed,
it is multiplied.

The first thing to do in making a lithograph is to
prepare the zinc plate. That is a simple matter.
But everything about lithography is simple. It has
only been made complicated by people who want
to wrap it in mystery, and in unionism, and various
things of that sort, which you artists will find are
not absolutely necessary to good work.

But again, as in all other arts, you have to know
how to draw.

The first thing is to prepare the plate by polishing
or graining it, and then to draw on it.  You see
// 297.png
.pn 280
the drawing which has been made on it. Then the
printer dampens the plate with water in a sponge. I
would not have done it that way. It is not necessary.
But he is doing it in his way. He wants to
clean the plate, to get the surplus chalk of the
drawing off the surface of the plate. I know it
should be left there, as it gives richness to the
prints.

After he has finished washing the drawing, if
anything is left of it—he has smeared it already—he
will, I believe—everybody has his own way—wash
it with gum arabic and water, and gum arabic
is supposed to be one of the most vital and important
and necessary—it is necessary—adjuncts to lithography.
The gum arabic protects the design, keeps
it from spreading, and also in a way etches it—what
I have told you about etching lines into a
plate or etching away the undrawn parts of it—as in
etching or photo-engraving—is not done in lithography
at all. In this, as you see, there is no etching
of lines into the plate, or leaving them in relief. The
whole is done on the surface by chemical affinity.
And the theory and the practice is this: The chalk
with which this drawing is made is composed of
grease and coloring matter, and grease attracts
grease and repels water. The printer now covers
the whole plate with ink, which is only the chalk
dissolved by having some oil mixed with it, in
order that he can use it on the roller. He let
the plate dry so the ink sticks to it all over.

He is doing it in his own way, and that is not
my way, but I have no doubt he will succeed quite
as well as I would. He rolls the ink all over the plate
to strengthen the chalk drawing on it, and he now
washes the ink off with water. Next he washes it with
// 298.png
.pn 281
gum arabic and water and a little acid mixed with
the gum arabic, and the tone of the ink comes off the
undrawn-on parts, leaving the drawing. Now it is
ready to prove. It is so simple to prepare a plate
that artists have rarely tried it; they have left it
to professional lithographers, and it has become
their property, as well as the most useful and the
most popular form of engraving.

The printer again dampens the plate and then
takes his large roller and rolls more ink on to the
dampened stone. The ink is adhering only on the
drawn-on parts. The rest of the surface is perfectly
clean. The damp, undrawn parts refuse the ink.

The old printers made another mystery about
this stage: you must never touch the plate or
scarcely look at it. In the old works on lithography
you were told to cover your face with a mask and
not breathe on it, and the most horrible thing was
to spit or sneeze on it. Hullmandel in the first
English treatise on the subject gives these warnings.
But some of us have found that it is a good thing to
look at the drawing, and keep looking at it to see how
it is getting along, and even get some finger marks
on it, which add tone to it, or if not wanted can
easily be taken off.

The first lithograph was made on a copper-plate
press. That is why I am using it, to show those of
you who have copper-plate presses that you can
print lithographs on them.

Senefelder used one in his experiments before
he designed a press; and so I want to see if it will not
work today as it did in the very beginning; the
inked plate with damp paper on it is run through
exactly as an etching. Of course, I cannot be
absolutely sure that it will print, because the most
// 299.png
.pn 282
extraordinary things happen or do not happen
whenever you attempt to make them happen in
lithography. I want to try Senefelder’s first method;
many artists today use copper-plate presses to prove
the plates which they have made.

Here is the print—it has printed. It has not
enough ink on it, yet the lines are all there, only they
are not inked enough. But that shows how long
it takes to print a drawing after it is made. Again
the printer dampens the plate, rolls more ink on it,
and more ink sticks to the lines; he lays another
sheet of paper on the plate, pulls down the tympan,
and runs it through the press; the proof is stronger;
it is right. He now washes the plate with acid to
prevent its absorbing more ink, and he can make
any number of prints.

Later Senefelder invented the lithograph press,
which in a way is very much better. In the copper-plate
press the pressure was obtained by rolling
the flat plate between the two cylinders when the
prints came off.

The lithograph press is made entirely differently,
because the lithographers found very soon that
nothing like so much pressure was needed, and they
also discovered it was very much easier to scrape the
ink off the plate by passing, as the printer will in a
moment, the plate or stone placed on this bed under
this heavy yoke. The bed is lifted up, and here in
the middle is a bar which carries a scraper at the
bottom. There is no necessity for the heavy pressure
of the copper-plate press. The zinc is now
inked again, paper laid on it, and as it passes under
this heavy yoke the ink is scraped off on the paper.
It does not require that enormous pressure which
was given to it by the copper-plate press. You see

// 302.png



// 303.png



// 304.png
.pn 287
how he lays the inked sheet of zinc on the bed of
the press, puts the paper on it, pulls down the
handle, and then the bed, as you see, rises up
against the scraper, and then he runs the whole bed
under the yoke, and the ink is scraped off by the
scraper as the plate passes beneath it.

Here is the proof, and you see how much richer
it has become. Compare it with the first proof. It
is only that more ink adheres to the drawing
as more ink is rolled on. And if the printer went on
inking it for any length of time without washing it
with acid—instead of acting as an etching does, and
getting weaker, a lithograph acts in exactly the
other way; it gets stronger and stronger—finally
it would become black all over, but even then it could
be washed out with acid. The printing lines get
black because the greasy ink sticks to them.

Now, in order to stop that he washes the plate
with a mixture of chrome acid and gum arabic, and
that prevents the ink from accumulating on the
drawing; it prevents the lines which were drawn
from absorbing more ink. The lithographic printers
call this etching. It is in no sense etching into
relief or etching hollows in the plate at all. It is only
stopping the plate from absorbing more ink.

Now he inks it again, after having dampened it,
rolls more ink on, and this is the whole secret of
lithography; this is the way in which the simplest
lithograph is made. And as you see, there are
no secrets about it, though there is as Whistler said,
“the secret in doing it,” and I can tell you that if
any of you came up and tried to ink that plate, tried
to ink it as he is doing with apparently no trouble
at all, and then pull it, you would make about as
bad a mess of it as could be made; it is not half as
// 305.png
.pn 288
easy as it looks. The printer does not even have
to take the plate off the press—he inks it on the
bed. There is another proof, just the same as the
other, and it would go on printing now that he has
washed it with acid, and give a large number of
proofs without getting stronger. I do not know
how many. That depends on the design on the
plate. I imagine this would print some thousands.
But that is not usually done, at any rate on a hand
press, but by steam—and from transfers, which I
will explain.

But the way in which most artists work today,
and the way in which it is necessary to work if you
are going to work out of doors, is to draw on paper.
All you do is to make the drawing on a sheet of rather
thin paper, any sort that you like—this one is on
tracing paper—the only absolute necessity is you
must use lithographic chalk. This method was the
earliest of Senefelder’s discoveries, yet the method
was abandoned for many years. The reason why
lithography has been revived is because artists have
learned that they can make their drawings on any
sort of paper they like, provided it is reasonably thin
and has not too much size in it. The next thing to
do after you have made your drawing on the paper
is to dampen it on the back; some printers use hot,
some cold water, some add turpentine or acid to it,
as he is doing now, and wash the stone or plate,
then pass it through the press, and a very extraordinary
thing will happen, or should happen—sometimes
it doesn’t happen. That is, as the drawing is
passed through the press, the grease which is in this
chalk with which the drawing is made, comes out
of the drawing on the paper and adheres to the zinc
plate, while the carbon or lead, or whatever the
// 306.png
.pn 289
black material is, stays on the paper. The black
is added to the grease only that the artist may see
the drawing. And if the experiment comes off
successfully you will see the most curious thing of
all—not reproduced, but multiplied art; that is,
you have your drawing and a print of it at the same
time. Sometimes you lose both, and I do not know
what will happen now.

The artistic development of lithography among
artists comes from this method, which has been
revived only within the last few years, the method
of drawing on paper, and having your drawings put
down on metal plates or stone. It makes no
difference which you use. The only reason that
zinc or aluminium is used is because it is much more
portable. You see this stone on which the zinc is
backed. It is placed here to raise the surface of
the plate up to the proper height in order that the
scraper may act on the face of it. Senefelder in
the <i>Grammar of Lithography</i> refers to the method but
does not describe it. I am showing it to you.

Stone is regarded as something sacred and precious
and holy because of the wonderful natural
grain that is in it. As a matter of fact, the stone
which Senefelder used, and which is used today,
the best of which comes from quarries in Bavaria,—Solenhoefen—is
perfectly smooth and has no
grain at all. The grain is artificial, and is put on
either by taking very fine sand which is sprinkled
on the face of the smooth stone, pouring water on it,
and then rubbing another small piece of stone in
every direction over it until the rubbing and scratching
of the sand between the two stones produces a
grain on the stone or on the zinc plate, or it may
be done in other ways. There are great roughened
// 307.png
.pn 290
marbles which are rolled violently around over it
in sand until the grain is made, or it is done by a
sand blast. The reason for using the grain is that
if you drew on a perfectly smooth stone, every line,
as in photo-engraving, would print perfectly black;
you would have no way of making greys. If you
want solid blacks only in the design, you do not
use any grain on the stone. These drawings may
be made with pen or chalk. But if you have a
drawing with tones—greys—in it, in order to keep
them and break up the solid blacks, there must be
a grain on the stone; or else they will all print solid
black. So much for that. There is, however, in the
artificial grain on the stone a certain quality, and
that quality is to certain artists very pleasing indeed,
but it has nothing to do with the art of lithography
at all, though some people say it gives the lithographic
quality. But it is not an artistic quality.
Many people prefer it; on the other hand, many
artists will have nothing to do with the stone;
they hate it. The Solenhoefen stone is best because
it has a uniform surface and absorbs water and
grease perfectly.

If you are doing a drawing in a lithograph shop
it is infinitely better to use the stone, because you
are sure that the drawing will print. But when
you make a drawing on paper and transfer it, as the
printer is going to do, to the stone, you are not
absolutely sure what you are going to get. The
result is in many ways uncertain.

Of course in working seriously one should have
all these things ready, but the great, eminent, and
very generous artists sent in their valuable contributions
only about ten minutes ago, and it requires
some little time to get them ready. There is no
// 308.png
.pn 291
great secret about this. All the printer has done
is to wet the back of the drawing with a sponge and
water.

He is going to transfer two drawings, and this
ought to be rather interesting, because one of them
is done on a thick piece of paper and is rather elaborate
in tone—they are both elaborate—and the
other is on a thinner paper. All he does now is to
lay them face downward on the stone. He must
be very careful about keeping all these plates and
stones damp, because otherwise, if the plate is allowed
to dry and the ink is rolled on it, when the drawing
is put down on it the grease is very liable to spread
and smear the drawing.

He is dampening the face of the zinc, that only
the drawn-on parts may take the ink. Lithography,
though so simple, is only beginning to be understood,
because for the fifty or sixty years in which it was
used only for commercial work, scarcely any experiments
were made. It is only within the last few
years that artists have been trying experiments,
and it is only within the last few years that we
have learned how many ways there are of making
drawings.

All the drawings I have here this afternoon are
drawn with chalk. But drawings may be made
with a pen on paper and transferred, as these now
will be. They can be made with a brush. They
can be made with wash, though that is rather unreliable
to transfer to stone, and it is better to make
wash drawings on stone, zinc, or aluminium.

He is now putting pressure on the press, and he
runs the drawing through it. I simply wanted to
see, by raising the edge of the paper, whether the
drawing had come off of the paper and adhered to
// 309.png
.pn 292
the stone, as it should. It sometimes takes several
runs of the press before the grease will come out.
The only danger in doing so is that the drawings
stick to the zinc plates, and then I can tell you
you have a very lively time to get that piece of paper
off. The professional printer does not work in this
way. He runs the paper repeatedly through the
press, wetting it each time till the paper becomes
pulp and is washed off, and the drawing adheres to
the stone.

You see now I lift them off the press and there
are the drawings, and very elaborate ones they are,
and nothing apparently has happened to them.
But I can see up here that the grease, or a certain
amount of it, has been extracted from them. There
are the drawings, apparently uninjured—in fact
they are not injured at all. You could run these
drawings through again, put them through the
press again and more grease would come off, because
there is still enough in them to transfer to the stone.

Putting them down in this way is what is called
transferring. This also was supposed to be wrapped
in mystery, but you have seen how the work is done.
But there is almost nothing to be seen on the stone.

In order to make these drawings print he will
wash the drawing on the plate with an inky rag.
There is hardly anything, that you can see. I can
see the ghost of the design of both of them. He
now washes them with gum arabic and water in a
way to protect them. And we are doing just as we
did last week in etching; I mean that we are doing
things in five minutes that we ought to take at
least five hours to do. And sometimes these affairs
become rather refractory and do not act the way
they ought to under such treatment.
// 310.png
.pn 293

But as he washes them with a rag which is dipped
in ink, the drawings are absorbing ink and coming
up. That is one of the most extraordinary things.
The zinc did absorb the grease which was in that
drawing, and the drawing will come up on the
plate, as you will see in a minute by rubbing more
greasy ink on it. Every bit of the grease on the
zinc will print.

One of the things which Senefelder said was that
lithography will be an excellent way for writing
secret documents, because you can write them in
invisible greasy ink, and when the documents are
received they can be rubbed up in the way he has
rubbed those designs up now, and the person who
receives the documents can read what has been
written in invisible ink. And such letters in lithographic
ink could be written over or under an
ordinary letter, transferred as he transferred these
designs, and rubbed up as he rubs them up, and the
whole would be legible. This drawing is coming
out perfectly now. It is the attraction of grease
for grease, and the repulsion of water by grease.

The drawing is all there but faint, and the other
one I expect will come up. If they had behaved
rightly, which they did not, enough grease would
have come off to show the design on the zinc. But
it can be coaxed up in the way in which he is doing
it now.

I believe the draughtsman was trying to get
the better of me by using Conté or some other
crayon; as a matter of fact he did not get the better
of me, but he got the better of the zinc, for nothing
will act on the plate but lithographic chalk. It is
not the fault of lithography, it is the fault of the
person who made the drawing, I am positive about
// 311.png
.pn 294
that. And that is the way the lithographer always
talks. He always blames the artist. You will
find, when the school starts, that you will get all
the blame. It is never the fault of the lithographer.
But I do think there is something wrong with the
chalk which has been used in this drawing. You
can see that one drawing has come out, as he rubbed
it up. The other one probably would come, but
it would come very slowly indeed. And we have
not time to humor and coax it. So we will try
others.

These drawings, after they have been transferred
and rubbed up in this way, ought to be
allowed to dry, because at this time the surface of
the zinc is very sensitive, and you can very easily,
when putting the ink on, either smear the drawing
all up and get it perfectly black, or rub it all off and
destroy the design. But the zinc and stone are
of a very forgiving nature as well as very absorbent,
otherwise they might object and give up entirely.
But they do act in an extraordinarily sensitive
fashion, as you will see.

It proves, as I said a moment ago, the advantage
of drawing on stone or on zinc, because then everything
you draw prints as you drew it, the only change
being that the drawing is reversed, as all engravings
are reversed.

These others, although you have not seen them
yet—have come perfectly; none of the black coloring
matter has been taken out of the designs at all.
Yet equally black designs are on the zinc plate—and
now they have printed perfectly and here
beside them are the originals.

There is no end, however, to the means or the
methods of making lithographs. Those colored

posters that you have seen, the war posters that were
issued for Liberty Loans, were nearly every one
of them—I think all of them—done in lithography,
but they were nearly all of them done by men and
women who did not know anything about lithography.
And the drawings were mostly made not
in lithographic chalk, but as water colors or oil
paintings, and when they had been so made, the
originals had to be photographed on to sheets of
zinc or stone or redrawn on the zinc or stone by a
trained craftsman in lithography, whereas if they
had been made in black and white just as the
Japanese wood cutters made their drawings, just
as the students have made these drawings, they
could then have been transferred just as these can
be, to the stone or metal plates, and printed. About
five of the five hundred artists who made war
posters understood lithography, and the other four
hundred and ninety-five did not. The consequence
was that the four hundred and ninety-five
posters had to be redrawn, and this not only delayed
the United States Liberty Loans, but it cost the
United States government an enormous sum of
money for unnecessary time and labor. And
every artist whose work was copied and redrawn
also was disappointed. He knew nothing about the
art, and most of the so-called lithographic artists
knew nothing about design, and the result was that
in every case the drawings were changed and lost in
character, excepting those of the half a dozen men
who did know. There was the usual row between
the artists and the lithographers, and in this case
the lithographers were right. Artists made drawings
for those Liberty Loan posters in colors which
would not reproduce, and they made them in such
// 317.png
.pn 300
a fashion that they had to be redrawn. And it
was all the fault of the artists who had not been
trained technically—and many of them were too
lazy or too stupid to learn or even care.

Now what you are going to learn in this school
is how to work, because lithography is a craft, and
you have got to learn that craft, and unless you
have mastered it—and there are many things which
are difficult and many which are easy—you are not
fit really, and you will never have the chance of
being allowed to work for a lithographer; because
even a lithographer is not a benevolent institution,
though a good many people seem to think that art
is a benevolent institution in which artists who have
not learned their trade can play tricks upon less
intelligent manufacturers, but even they know
enough not to allow it to be done, at any rate,
after one encounter with an ignorant artist.

If you are trying to make a design in color it
should be made in black and white, treated exactly
as a Japanese wood block is, as I have treated these
plates. When the black and white drawing has
been put on the stone or the zinc plate, as many
transfers of it in greasy ink should then be taken as
colors are wanted, one color for each stone or plate,
and those colors should be applied exactly as the
Japanese do one after the other, not one on top of
the other, as the lithographers do, but side by side
as a mosaic.

If you remember the two posters that I showed
you by Beardsley and by Falls, they were done in
this way, and they came out so wonderfully because
those artists knew how to draw, and draw for the
lithographer. And you must know how to draw—you
must know how to make lithographs before
// 318.png
.pn 301
you can make them. You have to have this technical
knowledge, and if you have not that knowledge,
you cannot do good work. And that is the great
good news that Mr. Eggers brought to you this
afternoon, that you are going to have a lithographic
school started here in which you can practice, and
if you can do good work you can become good
lithographers, and then, having studied art, studied
drawing and painting, you have a chance to work
in a practical way, a chance of making a decent
living. And if the Lord Almighty has made you an
artist, you have something to fall back on and
depend upon if the public has not the brains to
appreciate your painting. Meanwhile let us try
to print some more drawings. The drawings must
be perfectly dampened. Again one is on thin and
one on thick paper. Now when the printer runs
them through the press we shall see what will
happen.

These are good; you see the grease has come
out and adhered to the stone. There is the original
unchanged.

That is one of the few things which have been
discovered in lithography, as we thought, until
finally, on reading Senefelder’s book <i>The Grammar
of Lithography</i>, of which I showed you the title-page
on a slide the other day, we found that he knew
it, because he said, “There is still another way of
transferring by which the drawing can be saved,”
but then he did not tell us the way in which it could
be done. But I have shown you the way in which
it is done. And this art of extracting the grease
from the drawing and keeping the drawing is almost
the only thing the modern artists have discovered—and
yet all the while Senefelder knew it.
// 319.png
.pn 302

The printer is rubbing the zinc with gum and
water to protect them; now he washes the gum off,
and rubs them with ink to get on faster, but it is
not the best or the safest way; he should roll them
up with his roller, but in this land of hustle, we
do things in a hurry and repent at leisure.

There are an infinite number of other ways in
which lithographs can be made. For example, as
you may remember, I showed you one the other
day in which the whole surface of the stone was
blackened with a tone of ink and then the design
scratched out with a scraper or with a point
just as mezzotints are made. Aquatint grounds
can be put on the surface. The stone may be etched
into relief, or it may be engraved, or the drawing
may be etched into it.

There is no way at all by which a lithograph
cannot be made, or a beautiful result be obtained,
by a trained artist. Just as in all the other graphic
arts, there is that one little necessity—the artist
must know how to draw before he can make a
lithograph, or a work of art of any sort. And
besides he must be trained in the craft.

Those drawings are coming up perfectly now.
They will at first be somewhat weak, as the others
were, but they are all right. I do not know what
was the matter with the first one, but I think it was
the crayon the artist used instead of lithographic
chalk. The printer says it was, so that is the end
of it.

In making wash drawings it is better to work
directly on stone, because the transferring of wash is
very difficult, though it is being done now. And
those wash drawings that I showed you by Whistler
and other artists were done on stone, because, as
// 320.png
.pn 303
I say, the use of wash on paper is very uncertain,
and very unreliable. But few artists today are
using the stone, preferring paper, at any rate to
commence their work on. But after you have got
the drawing on the grained stone or zinc you can
work to any extent on it with chalk or with ink
or with wash. Before it has been etched, when it
is in the state that this is now, before it is washed
with gum and water, you can draw on it or take
anything from it. After it has been gummed up
and etched, it is rather difficult to make changes,
though you can remove the etched surface and the
gum and water by using other acid on it, counter-etching,
as the lithographer calls it, and then you
can make any changes you want to. You are not
prevented from making changes because you have
drawn on paper and then transferred the design
to stone. In fact, the only real difficulty about
making lithographs upon paper is that, unless you
have some specially prepared paper with a surface
through which you can scratch, you cannot make
any changes at all on the paper, and you must wait
until you get your drawing on the stone before you
do so.

There, he has taken the turpentine and washed
the drawing all out. It is apparently gone. That
is one of the most curious things about lithography.
But the grease is there in the plate. And now he
inks it with the inky roller, and now in a moment he
washes it out; it has disappeared; and now he rolls
it up, and the drawing has come back again. The
first time you make a lithograph and see that done
to your drawing you will have rather a fright. You
will think it is done for. But it is not. The grease
is in the stone or plate, and it will come back. It is
// 321.png
.pn 304
only the ink on the surface which the printer has
washed off.

The whole surface is now coated with ink in
order to get it to adhere to the drawing. One wishes
all the time that one could make use of that beautiful
tone which is now on the surface of the plate, but
there is no way that has been discovered yet of
really fixing it and getting tone, unless you draw a
tone on it with stumps or rags covered with powdered
or soft chalk—<i>touche</i>, the printers call it.

There are other ways, and I wish I had time, but
it would take a week to show you half the ways in
which lithographs are made. They will be taught.
They are what you are going to learn in this school
that is to be started at once. You will learn that
there are endless methods, and if you care for lithography
you will find them fascinating.

Now the ink is washed off, owing to the plate
having been dampened, only remaining on the lines,
and those two designs are coming up wonderfully,
perfectly, as well as they could be made to, right
away. You see how long it takes. There is no
intermediary, no one who copies your work, no photography,
no engraving or etching. These are the
drawings that the artists made, multiplied; not
reproduced, but multiplied. They have printed
perfectly. There is nothing so extraordinary in the
graphic arts as the sensitive way in which these
drawings disappear, and then reappear by having
a little ink put on them. It is nothing more than
the fact that the grease attracts grease and repels
water. It is magic, yet it is so simple, that artists
never even tried it for fifty years—so simple it fell
into the hands of the “manufacturer,” as the lithographer
calls himself.
// 322.png
.pn 305

This first print will probably be rather grey.
It is printed stunningly, the first time. That was
very well done indeed. In places it is too black.
We have too much ink on the plate, but that can
be washed with more of the acid, which will reduce
that strong patch in the hair. It is perfectly easy
to get the grey back; it is perfectly easy to do anything
except the drawing. The other parts of it
are right because the artist has learned to draw.

I could tell you any number of other methods,
but I think the time is up. I must say this, that
if you think you have learned anything from these
lectures which you have listened to during the
last three weeks, I am only too glad. I have shown
you how important in modern life the graphic arts
are. But as I have said, it is not by honoring me in
coming here to listen patiently that you will learn
anything, but it is by endless work. And now, in
one branch of the graphic arts, lithography, you are
going to have a chance to work practically as you
have in etching in this school. You are going to
have an opportunity that nobody in this country
ever had before, and you ought to thank the Art
Institute for giving you that opportunity. And if I
have had any part in helping to get practical art
education introduced into the art schools of the
Art Institute of Chicago, I am only too happy, and
I have not given the Scammon Lectures in vain.
